so if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it and either slit is observed it will not go through both slits if it s unobserved it will however if it s observed after it s left the plane but before it hits its target it will not have gone through both slits 
agreed what s your point 
there s no point i just think it s a good idea for a tee shirt 
excuse me 
one across is aegean eight down is nabakov twenty six across is mcm fourteen down is move your finger phylum which makes fourteen across port au prince see papa doc s capital idea that s port au prince haiti 
yes um is this the high iq sperm bank 
i think this is the place 
thank you we ll be right back 
leonard i don t think i can do this 
what are you kidding you re a semi pro 
no we are committing genetic fraud there s no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate high iq offspring think about that i have a sister with the same basic dna mix who hostesses at fuddruckers 
sheldon this was your idea a little extra money to get fractional t1 bandwidth in the apartment 
i know and i do yearn for faster downloads but there s some poor woman is going to pin her hopes on my sperm what if she winds up with a toddler who doesn t know if he should use an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve 
i m sure she ll still love him 
i wouldn t 
well what do you want to do 
i want to leave 
okay 
what s the protocol for leaving 
i don t know i ve never reneged on a proffer of sperm before 
let s try just walking out 
okay 
bye bye 
see you 
are you still mad about the sperm bank 
no 
you want to hear an interesting thing about stairs 
not really 
if the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimetres most people will trip 
i don t care two millimetres that doesn t seem right 
no it s true i did a series of experiments when i was twelve my father broke his clavicle 
is that why they sent you to boarding school 
no that was the result of my work with lasers 
new neighbour 
evidently 
significant improvement over the old neighbour 
two hundred pound transvestite with a skin condition yes she is 
oh hi 
hi 
hi 
hi 
hi 
hi 
we don t mean to interrupt we live across the hall 
oh that s nice 
oh uh no we don t live together um we live together but in separate heterosexual bedrooms 
oh okay well guess i m your new neighbour penny 
leonard sheldon 
hi 
hi 
hi 
hi 
hi well uh oh welcome to the building 
thankyou maybe we can have coffee sometime 
oh great 
great 
great 
great well bye 
bye 
bye 
bye 
should we have invited her for lunch 
no we re going to start season two of battlestar galactica 
we already watched the season two dvds 
not with commentary 
i think we should be good neighbours invite her over make her feel welcome 
we never invited louis slash louise over 
well then that was wrong of us we need to widen our circle 
i have a very wide circle i have 212 friends on myspace 
yes and you ve never met one of them 
that s the beauty of it 
i m going to invite her over we ll have a nice meal and chat 
chat we don t chat at least not offline 
well it s not difficult you just listen to what she says and then you say something appropriate in response 
to what end 
hi again 
hi 
hi 
hi 
hi 
anyway um we brought home indian food and um i know that moving can be stressful and i find that when i m undergoing stress that good food and company can have a comforting effect also curry is a natural laxative and i don t have to tell you that uh a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about 
leonard i m not expert here but i believe in the context of a luncheon invitation you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements 
oh you re inviting me over to eat 
uh yes 
oh that s so nice i d love to 
great 
so what do you guys do for fun around here 
well today we tried masturbating for money 
okay well make yourself at home 
okay thankyou 
you re very welcome 
this looks like some serious stuff leonard did you do this 
actually that s my work 
wow 
yeah well it s just some quantum mechanics with a little string theory doodling around the edges that part there that s just a joke it s a spoof of the bourne oppenheimer approximation 
so you re like one of those beautiful mind genius guys 
yeah 
this is really impressive 
i have a board if you like boards this is my board 
holy smokes 
if by holy smokes you mean a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men s room at mit sure 
what 
oh come on who hasn t seen this differential below here i sit broken hearted 
at least i didn t have to invent twenty six dimensions just to make the math come out 
i didn t invent them they re there 
in what universe 
in all of them that is the point 
uh do you guys mind if i start 
um penny that s where i sit 
so sit next to me 
no i sit there 
what s the difference 
what s the difference 
here we go 
in the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm and yet not so close as to cause perspiration in the summer it s directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there and there it faces the television at an angle that is neither direct thus discouraging conversation nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion i could go on but i think i ve made my point 
do you want me to move 
well 
just sit somewhere else 
fine 
sheldon sit 
aaah 
well this is nice we don t have a lot of company over 
that s not true koothrapali and wolowitz come over all the time 
yes i now but 
tuesday night we played klingon boggle until one in the morning 
yes i remember 
i resent you saying we don t have company 
i m sorry 
that is an antisocial implication 
i said i m sorry 
so klingon boggle 
yeah it s like regular boggle but in klingon that s probably enough about us tell us about you 
um me okay i m sagittarius which probably tells you way more than you need to know 
yes it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the sun s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow effects your personality 
participate in the what 
i think what sheldon s trying to say is that sagittarius wouldn t have been our first guess 
oh yeah a lot of people think i m a water sign okay let s see what else oh i m a vegetarian oh except for fish and the occasional steak i love steak 
that s interesting leonard can t process corn 
wu uh do you have some sort of a job 
oh yeah i m a waitress at the cheesecake factory 
oh okay i love cheesecake 
you re lactose intolerant 
i don t eat it i just think it s a good idea 
oh anyways i m also writing a screenplay it s about this sensitive girl who comes to l a from lincoln nebraska to be an actress and winds up a waitress at the cheesecake factory 
so it s based on your life 
no i m from omaha 
well if that was a movie i would go see it 
i know right okay let s see what else um that s about it that s the story of penny 
well it sounds wonderful 
it was until i fell in love with a jerk 
what s happening 
i don t know 
oh god you know four years i lived with him four years that s like as long as high school 
it took you four years to get through high school 
don t 
i just i can t believe i trusted him 
should i say something i feel like i should say something 
you no you ll only make it worse 
you want to know the most pathetic part even though i hate his lying cheating guts i still love him is that crazy 
yes 
no it s not crazy it s uh uh it s a paradox and paradoxes are part of nature think about light now if you look at huygens light is a wave as confirmed by the double slit experiments but then along comes albert einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too well i didn t make it worse 
oh i m so sorry i m such a mess and on top of everything else i m all gross from moving and my stupid shower doesn t even work 
our shower works 
really would it be totally weird if i used it 
yes 
no 
no 
no 
no 
it s right down the hall 
thanks you guys are really sweet 
well this is an interesting development 
how so 
it has been some time since we ve had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment 
that s not true remember at thanksgiving my grandmother with alzheimer s had that episode 
point taken it has been some time since we ve had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn t want to rip our eyes out 
the worst part was watching her carve that turkey 
so what exactly are you trying to accomplish here 
excuse me 
that woman in there s not going to have sex with you 
well i m not trying to have sex with her 
oh good then you won t be disappointed 
what makes you think she wouldn t have sex with me i m a male and she s a female 
yes but not of the same species 
i m not going to engage in hypotheticals here i m just trying to be a good neighbour 
oh of course 
that s not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that i wouldn t participate however briefly 
do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your luke skywalker no more tears shampoo 
it s darth vader shampoo luke skywalker s the conditioner 
wait till you see this 
it s fantastic unbelievable 
see what 
it s a stephen hawking lecture from mit in 1974 
this is not a good time 
it s before he became a creepy computer voice 
that s great you guys have to go 
why 
it s just not a good time 
leonard has a lady over 
yeah right your grandmother back in town 
no and she s not a lady she s just a new neighbour 
hang on there really is a lady here 
uh huh 
and you want us out because you re anticipating coitus 
i m not anticipating coitus 
so she s available for coitus 
can we please stop saying coitus 
technically that would be coitus interruptus 
hey is there a trick to getting it to switch from tub to shower oh hi sorry hello 
enchante madamoiselle howard wolowitz cal tech department of applied physics you may be familiar with some of my work it s currently orbiting jupiter s largest moon taking high resolution digital photographs 
penny i work at the cheesecake factory 
come on i ll show you the trick with the shower 
bon douche 
i m sorry 
it s french for good shower it s a sentiment i can express in six languages 
save it for your blog howard 
see ka tong guay jow 
uh there it goes it sticks i m sorry 
okay thanks 
you re welcome oh you re going to step right okay i ll 
hey leonard 
the hair products are sheldon s 
um okay can i ask you a favour 
a favour sure you can ask me a favour i would do you a favour for you 
it s okay if you say no 
oh i ll probably say yes 
it s just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you ve just met 
wow 
i really think we should examine the chain of causality here 
must we 
event a a beautiful woman stands naked in our shower event b we drive half way across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman s ex boyfriend query on what plane of existence is there even a semi rational link between these events 
she asked me to do her a favour sheldon 
ah yes well that may be the proximal cause of our journey but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause 
which is 
you think with your penis 
that s a biological impossibility and you didn t have to come 
oh right yes i could have stayed behind and watched wolowitz try to hit on penny in russian arabic and farsi why can t she get her own tv 
come on you know how it is with break ups 
no i don t and neither do you 
wuh i i broke up with joyce kim 
you did not break up with joyce kim she defected to north korea 
to mend her broken heart this situation is much less complicated there s some kind of dispute between penny and her ex boyfriend as to who gets custody of the tv she just wanted to avoid having a scene with him 
so we get to have a scene with him 
no sheldon there s not going to be a scene there s two of us and one of him 
leonard the two of us can t even carry a tv 
so you guys work with leonard and sheldon at the university 
uh i m sorry do you speak english 
oh he speaks english he just can t speak to women 
really why 
he s kind of a nerd juice box 
i ll do the talking 
hi i m leonard this is sheldon 
hello 
what did i just uh we re here to pick up penny s tv 
okay thanks for your time 
we re not going to give up just like that 
leonard the tv is in the building we ve been denied access to the building ergo we are done 
excuse me if i were to give up at the first little hitch i never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang 
my apologies what s your plan 
it s just a privilege to watch your mind at work 
come on we have a combined iq of 360 we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building 
what do you think their combined iq is 
just grab the door 
this is it i ll do the talking 
good thinking i ll just be the muscle 
i m leonard this is sheldon 
from the intercom 
oh we re scientists 
tell him about our iq 
leonard 
what 
my mom bought me those pants 
i m sorry 
you re going to have to call her 
sheldon i m so sorry i dragged you through this 
it s okay it wasn t my first pantsing and it won t be my last 
and you were right about my motives i was hoping to establish a relationship with penny that might have some day led to sex 
well you got me out of my pants 
anyway i ve learned my lesson she s out of my league i m done with her i ve got my work one day i ll win the nobel prize and then i ll die alone 
don t think like that you re not going to die alone 
thank you sheldon you re a good friend 
and you re certainly not going to win a nobel prize 
this is one of my favourite places to kick back after a quest they have a great house ale 
wow cool tiger 
yeah i ve had him since level ten his name is buttons anyway if you had your own game character we could hang out maybe go on a quest 
uh sounds interesting 
so you ll think about it 
oh i don t think i ll be able to stop thinking about it 
smooth 
we re home 
oh my god what happened 
well your ex boyfriend sends his regards and i think the rest is fairly self explanatory 
i m so sorry i really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn t be such an ass 
no it was a valid hypothesis 
that was a valid hypothesis what is happening to you 
really thank you so much for going and trying you re uh you re so terrific why don t you put some clothes on i ll get my purse and dinner is on me okay 
really great 
thank you you re not done with her are you 
our babies will be smart and beautiful 
not to mention imaginary 
is thai food okay with you penny 
sure 
we can t have thai food we had indian for lunch 
so 
they re both curry based cuisines 
so 
they would be gastronomically redundant i can see we re going to have to spell out everything for this girl 
any ideas raj 
turn left on lake street and head up to colorado i know a wonderful little sushi bar that has karaoke 
that sounds like fun 
baby baby don t get hooked on me uh baby baby don t get hooked on me 
i don t know what your odds are in the world as a whole but as far as the population of this car goes you re a veritable mack daddy 
there you go pad thai no peanuts 
but does it have peanut oil 
uh i m not sure everyone keep an eye on howard in case he starts to swell up 
since it s not bee season you can have my epinephrine 
are there any chopsticks 
you don t need chopsticks this is thai food 
here we go 
thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the nineteenth century interestingly they don t actually put the fork in their mouth they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth 
ask him for a napkin i dare you i ll get it 
do i look puffy i feel puffy 
hey leonard 
oh hi penny 
am i interrupting 
no 
you re not swelling howard 
no no look at my fingers they re like vienna sausages 
sounds like you have company 
they re not going anywhere so you re coming home from work that s great how was work 
well you know it s the cheesecake factory people order cheesecake and i bring it to them 
so you sort of act as a carbohydrate delivery system 
yeah call it whatever you want i get minimum wage yeah anyways i was wondering if you could help me out with something i was 
yes 
oh okay great i m having some furniture delivered tomorrow and i may not be here so oh hel hello 
i m sorry 
haven t you ever been told how beautiful you are in flawless russian 
no i haven t 
get used to it 
yeah i probably won t but hey sheldon 
hi 
hey raj still not talking to me huh 
don t take it personally it s his pathology he can t talk to women 
he can t talk to attractive women or in your case a cheesecake scented goddess 
so there s gonna be some furniture delivered 
yeah yeah if it gets here and i m not here tomorrow could you just sign for it and have them put it in my apartment 
yeah no problem 
great here s my spare key thank you 
penny wait 
yeah 
um if you don t have any other plans do you want to join us for thai food and a superman movie marathon 
a marathon wow how many superman movies are there 
you re kidding right 
yeah i do like the one where lois lane falls from the helicopter and superman swooshes down and catches her which one was that 
you realise that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy 
yes i know men can t fly 
oh no let s assume that they can lois lane is falling accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel miss lane who is now travelling at approximately 120 miles per hour hits them and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces 
unless superman matches her speed and decelerates 
in what space sir in what space she s two feet above the ground frankly if he really loved her he d let her hit the pavement it would be a more merciful death 
excuse me your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that superman s flight is a feat of strength 
are you listening to yourself it is well established that superman s flight is a feat of strength it is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings an ability he derives from earth s yellow sun 
yeah and you don t have a problem with that how does he fly at night 
uh a combination of the moon s solar reflection and the energy storage capacity of kryptonian skin cells 
i m just going to go wash up 
i have 26 hundred comic books in there i challenge you to find a single reference to kryptonian skin cells 
challenge accepted we re locked out 
also the pretty girl left 
okay her apartment s on the fourth floor but the elevator s broken so you re going to have to oh you re just going to be done okay cool thanks i guess we ll just bring it up ourselves 
i hardly think so 
why not 
well we don t have a dolly or lifting belts or any measurable upper body strength 
we don t need strength we re physicists we are the intellectual descendents of archimedes give me a fulcrum and a lever and i can move the earth it s just a matter i don t have this i don t have this i don t have this 
archimedes would be so proud 
do you have any ideas 
yes but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring 
easy easy okay now we ve got an inclined plane the force required to lift is reduced by the sine of the angle of the stairs call it thirty degrees so about half 
exactly half 
exactly half let s push okay see it s moving this is easy all in the math 
what s your formula for the corner 
what oh okay uh okay yeah no problem just come up here and help me pull and turn 
ah gravity thou art a heartless bitch 
you do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds of you having sexual congress with this woman 
men do things for women without expecting sex 
yeah those are men who just had sex 
i m doing this to be a good neighbour in any case there s no way it could lower the odds 
almost there almost there almost there 
no we re not no we re not no we re not 
watch your fingers watch your fingers oh god my fingers 
you okay 
no it hurt great caesar s ghost look at this place 
so penny s a little messy 
a little messy the mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy this is chaos excuse me explain to me an organisational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid i m just inferring that this is a couch because the evidence suggests the coffee table s having a tiny garage sale 
did it ever occur to you that not everyone has the compulsive need to sort organise and label the entire world around them 
no 
well they don t hard as it may be for you to believe most people don t sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fibre content 
excuse me but i think we ve both found that helpful at times 
come on we should go 
hang on 
what are you doing 
straightening up 
sheldon this is not your home 
this is not anyone s home this is a swirling vortex of entropy 
when the transvestite lived here you didn t care how he kept the place 
because it was immaculate i mean you open that man s closet it was left to right evening gowns cocktail dresses then his police uniforms 
what were you doing in his closet 
i helped run some cable for a webcam 
hey guys 
oh hey penny this just arrived we just brought this up just now 
great was it hard getting it up the stairs 
no 
no 
no 
no 
well we ll get out of your hair 
oh great thank you again 
penny i just want you to know that you don t have to live like this i m here for you 
what s he talking about 
it s a joke 
i don t get it 
yeah he didn t tell it right 
sheldon 
sheldon hello 
sheldon 
sssshhhh penny s sleeping 
are you insane you can t just break into a woman s apartment in the middle of the night and clean 
i had no choice i couldn t sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom was our living room and just outside our living room was that hallway and immediately adjacent to that hallway was this 
do you realise that if penny wakes up there is no reasonable explanation as to why we re here 
i just gave you a reasonable explanation 
no no you gave me an explanation it s reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers 
don t be ridiculous i have no peers 
sheldon we have to get out of here 
you might want to speak in a lower register 
what 
evolution has made women sensitive to high pitched noises while they sleep so that they ll be roused by a crying baby if you want to avoid waking her speak in a lower register 
that s ridiculous 
no that s ridiculous 
fine i accept your premise now please let s go 
i am not leaving until i m done 
o o o oh 
if you have time to lean you have time to clean 
oh what the hell 
morning 
morning 
i have to say i slept splendidly granted not long but just deeply and well 
i m not surprised a well known folk cure for insomnia is to break into your neighbour s apartment and clean 
sarcasm 
you think 
granted my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox but i think the end result will be a measurable enhancement of penny s quality of life 
you know what you ve convinced me maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet 
you don t think that crosses a line 
yes for god s sake sheldon do i have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time i open my mouth 
you have a sarcasm sign 
no i do not have a sarcasm sign 
do you want some cereal i m feeling so good today i m going to choose from the low fibre end of the shelf hello honey puffs 
son of a bitch 
penny s up 
you sick geeky bastards 
how did she know it was us 
i may have left a suggested organisational schematic for her bedroom closet 
leonard 
god this is going to be bad 
goodbye honey puffs hello big bran 
you came into my apartment last night when i was sleeping 
yes but only to clean 
really more to organise you re not actually dirty per se 
give me back my key 
i m very very sorry 
do you understand how creepy this is 
oh yes we discussed it at length last night 
in my apartment while i was sleeping 
and snoring and that s probably just a sinus infection but it could be sleep apnoea you might want to see an otolaryngologist it s a throat doctor 
and what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses 
depending on the depth that s either a proctologist or a general surgeon oh 
god 
okay look no penny i think what you re feeling is perfectly valid and maybe a little bit later today when you re feeling a little bit less for lack of a better word violated maybe we could talk about this some more 
stay away from me 
sure that s another way to go 
penny penny just to clarify because there will be a discussion when you leave is your objection solely to our presence in the apartment while you were sleeping or do you also object to the imposition of a new organisational paradigm well that was a little non responsive 
you are going to march yourself over there right now and apologise what s funny 
that wasn t sarcasm 
no 
wooh boy you are all over the place this morning i have a masters and two phd s i should not have to do this 
what 
i am truly sorry for what happened last night i take full responsibility and i hope that it won t colour your opinion of leonard who is not only a wonderful guy but also i hear a gentle and thorough lover i did what i could 
hey raj hey listen i don t know if you heard about what happened last night with leonard and sheldon but i m really upset about it i mean they just they let themselves into my place and then they cleaned it i mean can you even believe that how weird is that 
ooh she s standing very close to me oh my she does smell good what is that vanilla 
you know where i come from someone comes into your house at night you shoot okay and you don t shoot to wound i mean alright my sister shot her husband but it was an accident they were drunk what was i saying 
she s so chatty maybe my parents are right maybe i d be better off with an indian girl we d have the same cultural background and my wife would sing to my children the same lullabies my mother sang to me 
it s obvious that they meant well but i m just i m having a really rough time like i said i broke up with my boyfriend and it s just freaking me out 
i mean just because most of the men i ve known in my life happen to be jerks doesn t mean i should just assume leonard and sheldon are right 
that s exactly what i thought thank you for listening you re a doll 
grab a napkin homie you just got served 
it s fine you win 
what s his problem 
his imaginary girlfriend broke up with him 
been there 
hello sorry i m late but i was in the hallway chatting up penny 
really you rajesh koothrapali spoke to penny 
actually i was less the chatter than the chattee 
what did she say is she still mad at me 
well she was upset at first but probably because her sister shot somebody then there was something about you and then she hugged me 
she hugged you how did she hug you is that her perfume i smell 
intoxicating isn t it 
hi 
oh 
what s going on 
um here s the thing penny just as oppenheimer came to regret his contributions to the first atomic bomb so too i regret my participation in what was at the very least an error in judgement the hallmark of the great human experiment is the willingness to recognise one s mistakes some mistakes such as madame curie s discovery of radium turned out to have great scientific potential even though she would later die a slow painful death from radiation poisoning another example from the field of ebola research 
leonard 
yeah 
six two inch dowels 
check 
one package phillips head screws 
check 
guys seriously i grew up on a farm okay i rebuilt a tractor engine when i was like twelve i think i can put together a cheap swedish media centre 
no please we insist it s the least we can do considering 
considering what how great this place looks 
oh boy i was afraid of this 
what 
these instructions are a pictographic representation of the least imaginative way to assemble these components this right here is why sweden has no space program 
well uh it looked pretty good in the store 
it is an inefficient design for example penny has a flat screen tv which means all the space behind it is wasted 
we could put her stereo back there 
and control it how 
run an infra red repeater photocell here emitter here easy peasy 
good point how you gonna cool it 
hey guys i got this 
hang on penny how about fans here and here 
also inefficient and might be loud 
how about liquid coolant maybe a little aquarium pump here run some quarter inch pvc 
guys this is actually really simple 
hold on honey men at work the pvc comes down here maybe a little corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here 
oh really show me where we put a drip tray a sluice and an overflow reservoir 
and if water is involved we re going to have to ground the crap out of the thing 
guys it s hot in here i think i ll just take off all my clothes 
oh i ve got it how about if we replace panels a b and f and crossbar h with aircraft grade aluminium 
right then the entire thing s one big heat sink 
perfect leonard why don t you and sheldon go down to the junk yard and pick up about six square metres of scrap aluminium raj and i will run down to my lab and get the oxy acetaline torch 
meet back here in an hour 
done 
got it 
okay this place does look pretty good 
alright just a few more feet and here we are gentlemen the gates of elzebub 
good lord 
oooh 
don t panic this is what the last 97 hours have been about 
stay frosty there s a horde of armed goblins on the other side of that gate guarding the sword of azeroth 
warriors unsheathe your weapons magic wielders raise your wands 
lock and load 
raj blow up the gates 
blowing the gates control shift b oh my god so many goblins 
don t just stand there slash and move slash and move 
stay in formation 
leonard you ve got one on your tail 
that s alright my tail s prehensile i ll swat him off 
i ve got him leonard tonight i spice my meat with goblin blood 
raj no it s a trap they re flanking us 
oooh he s got me 
sheldon he s got raj use your sleath spell sheldon sheldon 
i ve got the sword of azeroth 
forget the sword sheldon help raj 
there is no more sheldon i am the swordmaster 
leonard look out 
dammit man we re dying here 
goodbye peasants 
the bastard teleported 
he s selling the sword of azeroth on ebay 
you betrayed us for money who are you 
i m a rogue knight elf don t you people read character descriptions wait wait wait somebody just clicked buy it now 
i am the swordmaster 
wooh i m all sweaty anybody want to log on to second life and go swimming i just built a virtual pool 
no i can t look at you or your avatar right now 
sounds like your neighbour s home 
excuse me 
don t forget the mail you took accidentally on purpose so you d have an excuse to talk to her 
oh right right right right right 
stealing snail mail very old school i like it 
um no hi leonard this is doug doug this is my neighbour leonard 
not much bro 
is is everything okay 
uh yeah uh i just i got your mail again here 
thank you i ve got to talk to that mailman 
oh no that s probably not such a good idea civil servants have a documented propensity to you know snap 
okay well thank you again 
no problem bye oh and bye bro 
penny for your thoughts 
what s the matter 
no i m fine penny s fine the guy she s kissing is really fine and 
kissing what kind of kissing cheeks lips chaste french 
what is wrong with you 
i m a romantic 
please don t tell me that your hopeless infatuation is devolving into pointless jealousy 
no i m not jealous i m just a little concerned for her i didn t like the look of the guy that she was with 
because he looked better than you 
yeah he was kinda dreamy 
well at least now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted smouldering wreckage that was once your fantasy of dating her and analyse the data so that you don t crash into geek mountain again 
i disagree love is not a sprint it s a marathon a relentless pursuit that only ends when she falls into your arms or hits you with the pepper spray 
well i m done with penny i m going to be more realistic and go after someone my own speed 
like who 
i don t know olivia geiger 
the dietician at the cafeteria with the limp and the lazy eye 
yeah 
well i don t think you have a shot there i have noticed that lesley winkle recently started shaving her legs now given that winter is coming one can only assume that she is signalling sexual availability 
i don t know you guys work in the same lab 
so 
there are pitfalls trust me i know when it comes to sexual harassment law i m a bit of a self taught expert 
look howard if i were to ask lesley winkle out it would just be for dinner i m not going to walk into the lab ask her to strip naked and dance for me 
oh then you re probably okay 
hello lesley 
lesley i would like to propose an experiment 
right lesley i would like to propose an experiment 
pfff i ve done it about two seconds 2 6 for minestrone anyway i was thinking more of a bio social exploration with a neuro chemical overlay 
i was going to characterise it as the modification of our colleague friendship paradigm with the addition of a date like component but we don t need to quibble over terminology 
there is a generally accepted pattern in this area i would pick you up take you to a restaurant then we would see a movie probably a romantic comedy featuring the talents of hugh grant or sandra bullock 
heartrate pheromones etc yes 
you mean kiss you now 
can you define the parameters of the kiss 
thank you shall i count down from three 
you proposed the experiment i think you should present your findings first 
none 
ah well thank you for your time 
none at all 
sheldon if you were a robot and i knew and you didn t would you want me to tell you 
that depends when i learn that i m a robot will i be able to handle it 
maybe although the history of science fiction is not on your side 
uh let me ask you this when i learn that i m a robot would i be bound by asimov s three laws of robotics 
you might be bound by them right now 
that s true have you ever harmed a human being or through inaction allowed a human being to come to harm 
of course not 
have you ever harmed yourself or allowed yourself to be harmed except in cases where a human being would have been endangered 
well no 
i smell robot 
hey what s going on 
the internet s been down for half an hour 
also sheldon may be a robot 
so how did it go with lesley 
oh we tried kissing but the earth didn t move i mean any more than the 383 miles that it was going to move anyway 
oh i ve seen that look before this is just going to be two weeks of moping and tedious emo songs and calling me to come down to pet stores to look at cats i don t know if i can take it 
you could power down 
well as usual wolowitz has the solution i happen to know a place where there are plenty of eligible women and leonard could have his pick 
i think mrs tishman s got her eye on you i ve been there you re in for a treat 
oh good lord 
you don t know me you don t wear my chains god that s a good song 
if you re compiling a mix cd for a double suicide oh i hope that scratching post is for you 
i know what you re thinking i ve taken your asthma into account there s a feline geneticist in san diego who has developed the cutest little hypo allergenic calicos 
leonard listen to me 
i ve been thinking about names i m kind of torn between einstein newton and sergeant fuzzyboots 
leonard do you really think you can satisfy your need for a relationship with a genetically altered cat 
maybe if it s a cute little cuddly cat 
oh come on leonard this is obviously about penny 
it doesn t matter the woman s not interested in me the woman rejected me 
okay look i think that you have as much of a chance of having a sexual relationship with penny as the hubble telescope does of discovering at the centre of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight searching for a circuit breaker nevertheless i do feel obligated to point out to you that she did no reject you you did not ask her out 
you re right i didn t ask her out i should ask her out 
no no now that was not my point my point was don t buy a cat 
no but you re right i should march over there and ask her out 
oh goody we re getting a cat 
ah hey leonard 
good afternoon penny so hi hey uh i was wondering if you had plans for dinner 
uh do you mean dinner tonight 
there is an inherent ambiguity in the word dinner technically it refers to the largest meal of the day whenever it is consumed so to clarify here by dinner i mean supper 
supper 
or dinner i was thinking six thirty if you can go or a different time 
uh six thirty s great 
really great 
yeah i like hanging out with you guys 
us guys 
you know sheldon howard raj who all s coming 
they might all be there or a subset of them might be there uh algebraically speaking there are too many unknowns for example sheldon had quizznos for lunch sometimes he finds that filling other times he doesn t it s no fault of quizznos they have a varied menu 
okay whatever it sounds like fun 
great did we say a time 
six thirty 
and that s still good for you 
it s fine 
cos it s not carved in stone 
no six thirty s great 
i ll get my chisel 
why 
to carve the okay i ll see you six thirty 
how do i look 
could you be more specific 
can you tell i m perspiring a little 
no the dark crescent shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely what time is your date 
six thirty 
perfect that gives you two hours and fifteen minutes for that dense molecular cloud of aramis to dissipate 
is it too much 
not if you re a rugby team 
by the way if it should ever come up you didn t join us because you stuffed yourself with a chicken carbonara sub at quizznos 
why would i join you 
no reason oh you know what maybe this isn t such a good idea 
oh no no no well now there s always the possibility that alcohol and poor judgement on her part might lead to a nice romantic evening 
you re right alcohol poor judgement it could go well 
of course there s the other possibility that this date kicks off a rather unpleasant six months of the two of you passing awkwardly in the hall until one of you breaks down and moves to another zip code 
you could have stopped at it could go well 
if i could of i would of 
i mean i m a perfectly nice guy there s no reason we couldn t go to the restaurant and have a lovely dinner maybe take a walk afterwards talk about things we have in common you love pottery i love pottery you know there s a pause we both know what s happening i lean in we kiss it s a little tentative at first but then i realise she s kissing me back and she s biting my lower lip you know she wants me this thing is going the distance we re going to have sex oh god oh my god 
is the sex starting now 
i m having a panic attack 
oh okay well then calm down 
if i could calm down i wouldn t be having a panic attack that s why they call it a panic attack 
alright alright well just sit down yes sit down now close your eyes 
why 
just do it 
okay 
now try to increase your alpha wave activity 
what 
it s a bio feedback technique it s relaxation through brain wave manipulation i read a paper about it in the journal of american neuroscience it was a little sparsely sourced but i think the basic science is valid i probably have it here somewhere 
oh who am i kidding i can t go through with this you need to call her and cancel 
me 
yes 
what should i tell her 
i don t know tell her i m sick 
okay 
not the kind of illness that will make her want to come over and take care of me but nothing so critical that she ll feel uncomfortable going out with me in the future if i want to try this again 
got it so i m assuming nothing venereal i ll just tell her that you had a routine colonoscopy and haven t quite bounced back 
give me the phone 
but i thought you wanted to cancel 
i can t because if i don t show up she ll still be expecting you 
why would she be expecting me 
stop asking me all these questions i need to take another shower 
so are the rest of the guys meeting us here 
oh yeah no turns out that raj and howard had to work and sheldon had a colonoscopy and he hasn t quite bounced back yet 
ooh my uncle just had a colonoscopy 
you re kidding well then that s something we have in common 
how 
we both have people in our lives who want to nip intestinal polyps in the bud 
so what s new in the world of physics 
nothing 
really nothing 
well with the exception of string theory not much has happened since the 1930 s and you can t prove string theory at best you can say hey look my idea has an internal logical consistency 
ah well i m sure things will pick up 
what s new at the cheesecake factory 
oh uh not much we do have a chocolate key lime that s moving pretty well 
good good and what about your uh hallway friend 
doug oh yeah i dunno i mean he s nice and funny but 
no you were saying but 
i d like a drink 
just say the but thing about doug and then i ll get her back 
okay well you know it s just me i m still getting over this break up with kurt and this thing with doug would be just rebound sex 
ugh don t get me started on rebound sex 
it s just it s my pattern i break up then i find some cute guy and then it s just thirty six meaningless of well you know 
i m not sure that i do um is that one thirty six hour experience or is it thirty six hours spread out over say one glorious summer 
no it s usually over a weekend and trust me you do not feel good after it 
well chafing right 
emotionally 
of course yeah emotional chafing hey do you want to see something cool i can make this olive go into this glass without touching it 
how 
physics 
wow centrifugal force 
actually it s centripetal force which is an inward force generated by the glass acting on the olive 
are you okay 
yeah i m okay did you spill ketchup 
no 
i m not okay 
are you sure you don t want to go to the emergency room 
no no i m okay it s stopped bleeding 
i know but you did throw up isn t that a sign of a concussion 
yes but i get car sick too so 
okay 
sorry about your car by the way 
oh no it s fine you got most of it out the window 
the poor guy on the bike i had a nice time 
yeah me too um good night leonard 
yeah 
was this supposed to be a date 
this no no of course not this was just you and me hanging out with a bunch of guys who didn t show up because of work and a colonoscopy 
okay i was just checking 
when i take a girl out on a date and i do she knows she s been dated capital d bold face underline like day ted i think i might have a little concussion i m going to go lay down for a while good night 
so how was your date 
awesome 
score one for liquor and poor judgement 
i ve been thinking about time travel again 
why did you hit a roadblock with invisibility 
put it on the back burner anyway it occurs to me if i ever did perfect a time machine i d just go into the past and give it to myself thus eliminating the need for me to invent it in the first place 
interesting 
yeah it really takes the pressure off 
sounds like a breakthrough should i call the science magazines and tell them to hold the front cover 
it s time travel leonard i will have already done that 
then i guess congratulations are in order 
no congratulations will have been in order you know i m not going to enjoy this party 
i know i m familiar with you 
at the last department party dr finkleday cornered me and talked about spelunking for 45 minutes 
yes i was there 
you know what s interesting about caves leonard 
what 
nothing 
well then we ll avoid finkleday we ll meet the new department head congratulate him shake his hand and go 
how s this pleased to meet you dr gablehouser how fortunate for you that the university has chosen to hire you despite the fact that you ve done no original research in 25 years and instead have written a series of popular books that reduce the great concepts of science to a series of anecdotes each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration of an average bowel movement mahalo 
mahalo s a nice touch 
do you know there are only eight consonants in the hawaiian language 
interesting you should lead with that 
oh god look at this buffet i love america 
you don t have buffets in india 
of course but it s all indian food you can t find a bagel in mumbai to save your life schmear me 
well here s an interesting turn of events 
what howard brought a date 
a more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has made an amazing leap forward 
hey what up science bitches may i introduce my special lady friend summer 
right sorry 
here comes our new boss be polite 
howard wolowitz 
an actual real scientist how was that 
i can t believe he fired me 
well you did call him a glorified high school science teacher whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts 
in my defence i prefaced that by saying with all due respect 
morning 
morning 
you re making eggs for breakfast 
this isn t breakfast it s an experiment 
huh cos it looks a lot like breakfast 
i finally have the time to test my hypothesis about the separation of the water molecules from the egg proteins and its impact vis a vis taste 
sounds yummy i look forward to your work with bacon 
as do i 
you know i m sure if you just apologised to gablehauser he would give you your job back 
i don t want my job back i ve spent the last three and a half years staring at greaseboards full of equations before that i spent four years working on my thesis before that i was in college and before that i was in the fifth grade this is my first day off in decades and i m going to savour it 
okay i ll let you get back to fixing your eggs 
i m not just fixing my eggs i m fixing everyone s eggs 
and we all thank you 
use new eggs 
hi hey i m running out to the market do you guys need anything 
oh well this would be one of those circumstances that people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence 
i m sorry 
i need eggs four dozen should suffice 
four dozen 
yes and evenly distributed amongst brown white free range large extra large and jumbo 
okay one more time 
never mind you won t get it right i d better come with you 
oh yay 
how come you didn t go into work today 
i m taking a sabbatical because i won t kow tow to mediocre minds 
so you got canned huh 
theoretical physicists do not get canned but yeah 
well maybe it s all for the best you know i always say when one door closes another one opens 
no it doesn t not unless the two doors are connected by relays or there are motion sensors involved 
no no i meant 
or the first door closing causes a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door 
never mind 
slow down slow down please slow down 
we re fine 
look you re not leaving yourself enough space between cars 
oh sure i am 
no no let me do the math for you this car weighs let s say 4 000lb now add say 140 for me 120 for you 
120 
oh i m sorry did i insult you is your body mass somehow tied into your self worth 
well yeah 
interesting anyway that gives us a total weight of let s say 4 400lb 
let s say 4 390 
fine we re travelling forward at good lord 51 miles an hour now let s assume that your brakes are new and the callipers are aligned still by the time we come to a stop we ll be occupying the same space as that buick in front of us an impossibility that nature will quickly resolve into death mutilation and oh look they built a new put put course 
this is great look at me out in the real world of ordinary people just living their ordinary colourless workaday lives 
thank you 
no thank you and thank you ordinary person hey you want to hear an interesting thing about tomatoes 
uh no no not really listen didn t you say you needed some eggs 
uh yes but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth knows to pick up their refrigerated foods on the way out of the supermarket 
oh okay well maybe you should start heading on out then 
no this is fun oh the thing about tomatoes and i think you ll really enjoy this is they re shelved with the vegetables but they re technically a fruit 
interesting 
isn t it 
no i mean what you find enjoyable 
oh boy 
what now 
well there s some value to taking a multivitamin but the human body can only absorb so much what you re buying here are the ingredients for very expensive urine 
well maybe that s what i was going for 
well then you ll want some manganese 
that was fun maybe tomorrow we can go to one of those big warehouse stores 
oh i don t know sheldon it s going to take me a while to recover from all the fun i had today 
are you sure there are a lot of advantages to buying in bulk for example i noticed that you purchase your tampons one month s supply at a time 
what 
well think about it it s a product that doesn t spoil and you re going to be needing them for at least the next thirty years 
you want me to buy thirty years worth of tampons 
well thirty thirty five hey when did your mother go into menopause 
okay i m not talking about this with you 
oh penny this is a natural human process and we re talking about statistically significant savings now if you assume 15 tampons per cycle and a 28 day cycle are you fairly regular okay no warehouse store but we re still on for put put golf right 
hey i just ran into penny she seemed upset about something 
i think it s her time of the month i marked the calendar for future reference 
what s with the fish 
it s an experiment 
what happened to your scrambled egg research 
oh that was a dead end scrambled eggs are as good as they re ever going to be 
so fish 
i read an article about japanese scientists who inserted dna from luminous jellyfish into other animals and i thought hey fish nightlights 
fish nightlights 
it s a billion dollar idea shhhhh 
mum s the word sheldon are you sure you don t want to just apologise to gablehauser and get your job back 
oh no no no no i ve too much to do 
like luminous fish 
shhhhh 
right i didn t 
that s just the beginning i also have an idea for a bulk mail order feminine hygiene company oh glow in the dark tampons leonard we re going to be rich 
thank you for coming on such short notice 
i didn t know what else to do he s lost all focus every day he s got a new obsession this is a particularly disturbing one 
mommy 
you called my mother 
thank you 
i was working with luminous fish and i thought hey loom mom what are you doing here 
i know but why 
because one of the great minds of the twenty first century is raising glow in the dark fish and weaving sarapes 
this is not a sarape this is a poncho a sarape is open at the sides a poncho is closed this is a poncho and neither is a reason to call someone s mother 
really when was the last time you left the house 
i went to the market with penny 
that was three weeks ago 
well then buckle up in the next four to eight days she s going to get very crabby 
yes well i m not a child i m a grown man capable of living my life as i see fit and i certainly don t need someone telling on me to my mother 
where are you going 
to my room and no one s allowed in 
oh 
i see 
sheldon your mum made dinner 
i m not hungry 
are we so sure that s a bad thing 
excuse me for being so bold but i now see where sheldon gets his smouldering good looks 
that is a lovely story um are we going to do anything about sheldon 
sounds like a wise man 
has shelly ever freaked out like this before 
what happened 
a death ray 
no we re not we re not not a couple two singles like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that are friends 
oh yeah 
oh my god this is the best cobbler i ve ever had 
love 
hey look who s come out 
this is ridiculous dammit sheldon snap out of it you re a physicist you belong at the university doing research not hiding in your room 
morning 
it s my idea of what dna would look like in a silicon based life form 
what do you want mom 
yeah 
what for 
no 
i m not going to apologise i didn t say anything that wasn t true 
why not 
wouldn t have been any ass kickings if that stupid death ray had worked 
really that s impressive 
dr gablehouser 
um as you know several weeks ago in our first encounter we may have gotten off on the wrong foot when i called you an idiot and i just wanted to say that i was wrong to point it out 
okay 
hey how did it go 
i got my job back 
really what happened 
i m not quite sure it involves a part of the human experience that has always eluded me 
that narrows it down 
thanks mom mom 
is dr gablehouser going to be my new daddy 
alright i m moving my infantry division augmented by a battalion of orcs from lord of the rings we flank the tennessee volunteers and the north once again wins the battle of gettysburg 
not so fast remember the south still has two infantry divisions plus superman and godzilla 
no no no no orcs are magic superman is vulnerable to magic not to mention you already lost godzilla to the illinois cavalry and hulk 
why don t you just have robert e lee charge the line with shiva and ganesh 
hi you guys ready to order 
hang on honey shiva and ganesh the hindu gods against the entire union army 
and orcs 
i ll be back 
excuse me ganesh is the remover of obstacles and shiva is the destroyer when the smoke clears abraham lincoln will be speaking hindi and drinking mint juleps 
alright my boss says you either have to order or leave and never come back 
what do you recommend for someone who worked up a man sized appetite from a morning of weight training and cardio funk 
a shower 
i ll take the heart smart platter 
alright thank you and sheldon 
we don t eat here i don t know what s good 
well it s all good 
statistically unlikely 
just get a hamburger you like hamburgers 
i like the hamburgers where we usually have hamburgers you can t make the assumption that i ll like the hamburgers here 
i m sorry give him a hamburger 
uh which one the classic burger the ranch house burger the barbecue burger or the kobe burger 
can t we just go to big boy they only have one burger the big boy 
the barbecue burger is like the big boy 
excuse me in a world that already includes the big boy why would i settle for something like a big boy 
because you are not at big boy 
fine i ll have the barbecue burger 
make it two 
waitresses don t yell at you at big boy 
hey lesley 
we don t this is a disturbing aberration 
lesley this is penny she lives across the hall from sheldon and me 
and walks in quiet beauty like the night 
howard i ve asked you not to do that 
lesley and i do research together at the university 
oh wow a girl scientist 
what happened to elliot wong 
yeah sure why not 
why at my place 
yeah you too leonard i didn t know you played the cello 
yeah my parents felt that naming me leonard and putting me in advanced placement classes wasn t getting me beaten up enough 
if you re into music i happen to be a human beatbox 
really i m actually not that into music so hey your friend s really cute anything going on with you two 
lesley no no oh what are you kidding 
he asked her out once it was an embarrassing failure 
thank you sheldon 
oh i m sorry was that supposed to be a secret 
oh that s too bad you guys would make a cute couple 
oh dear 
what s the matter 
she didn t take my order 
how can she take your order when you re too neurotic to talk to her 
nevertheless this will be reflected in her tip 
what did penny mean you d make a cute couple 
well i assume she meant that the two of you together would constitute a couple that others might consider cute an alternate and somewhat less likely interpretation is that you could manufacture one as in oh look leonard and lesley made mr and mrs goldfarb aren t they adorable 
if penny didn t know that lesley had already turned me down then that would unambiguously mean that she penny thought that i should her lesley out indicating that she penny had no interest in me asking her penny out but because she did know that i had asked lesley out and that she lesley had turned me down then she penny could be offering consolation that s too bad you would have made a cute couple but while thinking good leonard remains available 
you re a lucky man leonard 
how so 
you re talking to one of the three men in the western hemisphere capable of following that train of thought 
well what do you think 
i said i could follow it i didn t say i cared 
thank you 
that was fun lesley thanks for including me 
uh sure why not 
really 
i thought you weren t interested in me 
you mean my cello 
no kidding 
gee uh 
penny what about her 
well i did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast which could give a positive urine test for opiates but certainly not dilate my pupils so i guess there s no point in bringing it up 
no no there s nothing going on between penny and me 
yeah yeah i guess i am 
yeah yeah it is good did you want to start now 
oh okay a little musical foreplay terrific 
i m good i m good to go 
oh hey sheldon what s going on 
i need your opinion on a matter of semiotics 
i m sorry 
semiotics the study of signs and symbols it s a branch of philosophy related to linguistics 
okay sweetie i know you think you re explaining yourself but you re really not 
just come with me 
well 
well what 
what does it mean 
oh come on you went to college 
yes but i was eleven 
alright look a tie on the doorknob usually means someone doesn t want to be disturbed because they re you know getting busy 
so you re saying leonard has a girl in there 
well either that or he s lost his tie rack and gotten really into bryan adams 
we really shouldn t be standing here 
this is very awkward 
oh come on you know leonard s had girls over before right 
oh yes but there s usually planning courtship and advance notice last time i was able to book a cruise to the arctic to see a solar eclipse 
wait you had to leave the state because your roommate was having sex 
i didn t have to the dates just happened to coincide 
so do you know who s in there 
well there s leonard and he s either with lesley winkle or a 1930 s gangster 
hmmm good for him good for leonard okay night 
no no wait hold on 
what s the matter 
i don t know what the protocol is here do i stay do i leave do i wait to greet them with a refreshing beverage 
gee sheldon you re asking the wrong girl i m usually on the other side of the tie 
hi leonard it s me sheldon in the living room i just i wanted you to know i saw the tie message received you re welcome you carry on give my best to lesley 
big boy someone touched my board oh god my board leonard leonard 
hey what s the matter 
my equations someone s tampered with my equations 
are you sure 
of course i m sure look at the beta function of quantum chrono dynamics the sign s been changed 
oh yeah but doesn t that fix the problem you ve been having 
are you insane are you out of your mind are you hey look that fixes the problem i ve been having 
you did this 
cool 
thank you i ll see you at work 
uh duh hold on hold on 
who told you you could touch my board 
i don t come into your house and touch your board 
oh that is so so 
inconsiderate that is the adjective inconsiderate 
you can stare at your board all day sheldon she s still going to be right 
i m not staring i m mulling 
oh hey leonard 
oh hi 
so how s it going 
pretty good 
just pretty good i d think you were doing very good 
pretty very there s really no objective scale for delineating variations of good why do you ask 
well a little bird told me that you and lesley hooked up last night 
sheldon 
i m coming 
so is it serious do you like her 
wuh i don t th th th that s really two different questions uh i m not sheldon we have to go 
boy you re wound awfully tight for a man who just had sexual intercourse 
alright well i ll talk to you later but i am so happy for you leonard 
thank you what did she mean she s happy for me is she happy because i m seeing someone or is she happy because she thinks that i m happy because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy you know because the second person though happy is now romantically unavailable to the first person 
do you realise i may have to share a nobel prize with your booty call 
you know what i m being ridiculous but who cares what penny thinks lesley is a terrific girl she s attractive we like each other she s extremely intelligent 
she s not that intelligent 
she fixed your equation 
she got lucky 
you don t believe in luck 
i don t have to believe in it for her to be lucky 
regardless i have a chance at a real relationship with lesley i m not going to pass that up for some hypothetical future happiness with a woman who may or may not want me to be happy with a woman who is currently making me happy 
leonard 
yeah 
i still don t care 
hey lesley 
brrrr why are you smashing a flash frozen banana 
so anyway hello 
just extending the intimacy do you want to slip over to the radiation lab and share a decontamination shower 
i m not sure but i think i m about to discover how the banana felt 
who wouldn t 
yeah well i m just glad to be a part of it so what happens now 
oh okay thank you 
you want to make plans for new years 
sorry 
hey look it s doctor stud 
doctor what 
the blogosphere is a buzzing with news of you and lesley winkle making eine kleine bang bang music 
wha how did it get on the internet 
i put it there 
well how did you know about it 
a little bird told us apparently you are a magnificent beast 
well that part s true 
you know i think i may have misjudged this restaurant 
no kidding 
i won t go out on a limb but i think we may be looking at my new tuesday hamburger 
your old tuesday hamburger will be so broken hearted 
way ahead of you i was thinking of moving big boy to thursdays and just dropping soup plantation 
really 
yeah the name always confused me anyway soup plantation you can t grow soup 
so how s everything 
terrific you ll be happy to know that i plan to come here every tuesday night for the foreseeable future 
really oh yay 
who do i speak to about permanently reserving this table 
um i don t know a psychiatrist so hey how are things with you and lesley 
oh to be honest i don t think it s going to work out 
oh oh that s too bad well hey don t worry i m sure there is someone out there who is just right for you 
well what did she mean by that was that just a generic platitude or was that a subtle bid for attention 
you know why this hamburger surpasses the big boy this is a single decker hamburger whereas the big boy is a double decker this has a much more satisfying meat to bun to condiment ratio 
are you even listening to me 
of course i m listening blah blah hopeless penny delusion blah blah blah 
okay then you know you can grow the ingredients for soup 
okay if no one else will say it i will we really suck at paintball 
that was absolutely humiliating 
oh come on some battles you win some battles you lose 
yes but you don t have to lose to kyle bernstein s bar mitzvah party 
i think we have to acknowledge those were some fairly savage pre adolescent jews 
you know we were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command 
sheldon let it go 
no i want to talk about the fact that wolowitz shot me in the back 
i shot you for good reason you were leading us into disaster 
i was giving clear concise orders 
you hid behind a tree yelling get the kid in the yarmulkah get the kid in the yarmulkah 
oh hey guys 
hello penny 
morning ma am 
so how was paintball did you have fun 
sure if you consider being fragged by your own troops fun you clear space on your calendar there will be an enquiry 
okay um oh hey i m having a party on saturday so if you guys are around you should come by 
a party 
yeah 
a boy girl party 
well there will be boys and there will be girls and it is a party so it ll just be a bunch of my friends we ll have some beer do a little dancing 
dancing 
yeah i don t know penny 
the thing is we re not 
we re really more 
no 
but thanks thanks for thinking of us 
are you sure come on it s halloween 
a halloween party 
as in costumes 
well yeah 
is there a theme 
um yeah halloween 
yes but are the costumes random or genre specific 
as usual i m not following 
he s asking if we can come as anyone from science fiction fantasy 
sure 
what about comic books 
fine 
anime 
of course 
tv film d d manga greek gods roman gods norse gods 
anything you want okay any costume you want bye 
gentlemen to the sewing machines 
oh no 
oh no 
make way for the fastest man alive oh no 
see this is why i wanted to have a costume meeting 
we all have other costumes we can change 
or we could walk right behind each other all night and look like one person going really fast 
no no no it s a boy girl party this flash runs solo 
okay how about this nobody gets to be the flash we all change agreed 
i call frodo 
hey sorry i m late but my hammer got stuck in the door on the bus 
you went with thor 
what just because i m indian i can t be a norse god no no no raj has to be an indian god that s racism i mean look at wolowitz he s not english but he s dressed like peter pan sheldon is neither sound nor light but he s obviously the doppler effect 
i m not peter pan i m robin hood 
really because i saw peter pan and you re dressed exactly like cathy rigby she was a little bigger than you but it s basically the same look man 
hey sheldon there s something i want to talk to you about before we go to the party 
i don t care if anybody gets it i m going as the doppler effect 
no it s not 
if i have to i can demonstrate neeeeoooowwwww 
terrific um this party is my first chance for penny to see me in the context of her social group and i need you not to embarrass me tonight 
well what exactly do you mean by embarrass you 
for example tonight no one needs to know that my middle name is leakey 
well there s nothing embarrassing about that your father worked with lewis leakey a great anthropologist it had nothing to do with your bed wetting 
all i m saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity for penny to see me as a member of her peer group a potential close friend and perhaps more i don t want to look like a dork 
just a heads up fellas if anyone gets lucky i ve got a dozen condoms in my quiver 
oh hey guys 
hey sorry we re late 
late it s 7 
and you said the party starts at seven 
well yeah when you start a party at seven no one shows up at you know seven 
it s 7 
yes yes it is okay well um come on in 
what are all the girls in the bathroom 
probably but in their own homes 
so what time does the costume parade start 
the parade 
yeah so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume you know most frightening most authentic most accurate visual representation of a scientific principle 
oh sheldon i m sorry but there aren t going to be any parades or judges or prizes 
this party is just going to suck 
no come on it s going to be fun and you all look great i mean look at you thor and oh peter pan that s so cute 
actually penny he s rob 
i m peter pan and i ve got a handful of pixie dust with your name on it 
no you don t oh hey what s sheldon supposed to be 
oh he s the doppler effect 
yes it s the apparent change in the frequency of a wave caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer 
oh sure i see it now the doppler effect alright i ve got to shower you guys um make yourselves comfortable 
okay 
see people get it 
mmmm by odin s beard this is good chex mix 
no thanks peanuts i can t afford to swell up in these tights 
i m confused if there s no costume parade what are we doing here 
we re socialising meeting new people 
telepathically 
oh hey when did you get here hi 
penny is wearing the worst catwoman costume i have ever seen and that includes halle berry s 
she s not catwoman she s just a generic cat 
and that s the kind of sloppy costuming which results from a lack of rules and competition 
hey guys check out the sexy nurse i believe it s time for me to turn my head and cough 
what is your move 
i m going to use the mirror technique she brushes her hair back i brush my hair back she shrugs i shrug subconsciously she s thinking we re in sync we belong together 
where do you get this stuff 
you know psychology journals internet research and there s this great show on vh1 about how to pick up girls 
oh if only i had his confidence i have such difficulty speaking to women or around women or at times even effeminate men 
if that s a working stethoscope maybe you d like to hear my heart skip a beat 
no seriously you can i have transient idiopathic arrhythmia 
i want to get to know penny s friends i just i don t know how to talk to these people 
well i actually might be able to help 
how so 
like jane goodall observing the apes i initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured but patterns emerge they have their own language if you will 
go on 
well it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting how wasted am i which is met with an approving chorus of dude 
then what happens 
that s as far as i ve gotten 
this is ridiculous i m jumping in 
good luck 
no you re coming with me 
oh i hardly think so 
come on 
aren t you afraid i ll embarrass you 
yes but i need a wing man 
alright but if we re going to use flight metaphors i m much more suited to being the guy from the faa analysing wreckage 
hi 
hello 
me i ll give you a hint neeeeooooowwwww 
close neeeeeoooooowwwww 
neeeeeooooowwwwww 
i m the doppler effect 
why don t you just tell people you re a zebra 
well why don t you just tell people you re one of the seven dwarves 
because i m frodo 
yes well i m the doppler effect 
oh no 
what 
that s penny s ex boyfriend 
what do you suppose he s doing here besides disrupting the local gravity field 
if he were any bigger he d have moons orbiting him 
oh snap so i guess we ll be leaving now 
why should we leave for all we know he crashed the party and penny doesn t even want him here 
you have a back up hypothesis 
maybe they just want to be friends 
or maybe she wants to be friends and he wants something more 
then he and i are on equal ground 
yes but you re much closer to it than he is 
look if this was 15 000 years ago by virtue of his size and strength kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners 
and male partners animal partners large primordial eggplants pretty much whatever tickled his fancy 
yes but our society has undergone a paradigm shift in the information age sheldon you and i are the alpha males we shouldn t have to back down 
true why don t you text him that and see if he backs down 
no i m going to assert my dominance face to face 
face to face are you going to wait for him to sit down or are you going to stand on a coffee table 
hello penny hello kurt 
oh hey guys you having a good time 
given the reaction to my costume this party is a scathing indictment of the american education system 
yet another child left behind 
no i m a hobbit 
uh a hobbit is a mortal halfling inhabitant of middle earth whereas an elf is an immortal tall warrior 
because he is neither tall nor immortal and none of us could be the flash 
i think we re all talking to penny here 
i m not no offence 
alright kurt be nice 
kurt 
okay i understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me i mean you can t compete with me on an intellectual level and so you re driven to animalistic puffery 
of course not no he s not you re not right leonard 
no i said animalistic of course we re all animals but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree 
if he understands that you re in trouble 
you re in trouble 
okay kurt please 
no penny it s okay i can handle this i m not a dwarf i m a hobbit a hobbit are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus preventing the conversion from short term to long term memory 
a homo habilus discovering his opposable thumbs says what 
i think i ve made my point 
let me remind you while my moral support is absolute in a physical confrontation i will be less than useless 
there s not going to be a confrontation in fact i doubt if he can even spell confrontation 
kurt put him down this instant 
i don t care i m finishing it put him down 
he s a hobbit i ve got your back 
leonard are you okay 
yeah no i m fine it s good it s a good party thanks for having us it s just getting a little late so 
oh okay alright well thank you for coming 
happy halloween if it s any consolation i thought that homo habilus line really put him in his place 
what s that 
tea when people are upset the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages there there you want to talk about it 
no 
good there there was really all i had 
good night sheldon 
good night leonard 
hey leonard 
hi penny 
hey i just wanted to make sure you re okay 
i m fine 
i m so sorry about what happened 
it s not your fault 
yes it is that s why i broke up with him he always does stuff like that 
so why was he at your party 
well i ran into him last week and he was just all apologetic about how he s changed he was just going on and on and i believed him and i m an idiot because i always believe guys like that and i can t go back to my party because he s there and i know you don t want to hear this and i m upset and i m really drunk and i just want to 
there there 
god what is wrong with me 
nothing you re perfect 
gah i m not perfect 
yes you are 
you really think so don t you 
penny 
yeah 
how much have you had to drink tonight 
just a lot 
are you sure that your being drunk and your being angry with kurt doesn t have something to do with what s going on here 
it might boy you re really smart 
yeah i m a frickin genius 
leonard you are so great why can t all guys be like you 
because if all guys were like me the human race couldn t survive 
i should probably go 
probably 
that s right you saw what you saw that s how we roll in the shire 
coming 
hey have you seen koothrapali 
he s not here maybe the avenger summoned him 
he s not the marvel comic story he s the original norse god 
thank you for the clarification 
i m supposed to give him a ride home 
well i m sure he ll be fine he has his hammer 
watch this it s really cool call leonard hofstadter 
no call leonard hofstadter 
no 
here let me try call mcflono mcfloonyloo heh heh 
oh that s very impressive and a little racist 
if we re all through playing mock the flawed technology can we get on with halo night we were supposed to start at eight it is now 8 
so we ll start now 
yes first we have to decide if those lost six minutes will be coming out of game time bathroom time or the pizza break 
we can split it two two and two 
if we re having anchovies on the pizza we can t take it out of bathroom time 
oh what fresh hell is this 
hey penny come on in 
hey guys 
see a penny pick her up and all the day you ll have good luck 
no you won t uh can i hide out here for a while 
sure what s going on 
well there s this girl i know from back in nebraska christie well anyway she called me up and she s like hey how s california and i m like awesome cos you know it s not nebraska and the next thing i know she s invited herself out here to stay with me 
8 
anyway she got here today and she s just been in my apartment yakkety yakking about every guy she s slept with in omaha which is basically every guy in omaha and washing the sluttiest collection of underwear you have ever seen in my bathroom sink 
well is she doing it one thong at a time or does she just throw it all in like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse 
he really needs to dial it down 
so if you don t like this christie why are you letting her stay 
well she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my brother so she s kind of family 
you know i apologise for my earlier outburst who needs halo when we can be regaled with the delightfully folksy tale of the whore of omaha 
oh i don t think she s a whore 
no yeah she s definitely a whore i mean she has absolutely no standards this one time she was at where s howard 
bonjour mademoiselle i understand you re new in town 
oh good grief 
ugh i cannot believe christie let howard into my apartment 
and i cannot believe people pay for horoscopes but on a more serious note it s 8 
okay fine we ll just play one on one until he gets back 
one on one we don t play one on one we play teams not one on one one on one 
well the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut raj in half 
oh sure cut the foreigner in half there s a billion more where he came from 
hey if you guys need a fourth i ll play 
great idea 
uh no the wheel was a great idea relativity was a great idea this is a notion and a rather sucky one at that 
why 
why oh penny penny penny 
oh what what what 
this is a complex battle simulation with a steep learning curve there are myriad weapons vehicles and strategies to master not to mention an extremely intricate back story 
oh cool whose head did i just blow off 
mine 
okay i got this lock and load boys 
it s the only way we can play teams 
yes but whoever s her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of experience and not to mention that fact that sh 
ha ha there goes your head again 
okay this isn t at all good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who s just respawned you need to give them a chance to now come on 
raj raj she s got me cornered cover me 
cover this suckers ha ha ha 
penny you are on fire 
yeah so is sheldon 
okay that s it i don t know how but she is cheating no one can be that attractive and be this skilled at a video game 
wait wait sheldon come back you forgot something 
what 
this plasma grenade ha look it s raining you 
you laugh now you just wait until you need tech support 
gosh he s kind of a sore loser isn t he 
well to be fair he is also a rather unpleasant winner 
well it s been fun 
you know penny we make such a good team maybe we could enter a couple of halo tournaments sometime 
or we could just have a life 
i guess for you that s an option 
good night leonard 
good night 
as usual nice talking to you raj 
what do you suppose she meant by that 
she s an enigma raj 
and another thing there s a certain ethic to the game penny a well estab 
she s gone sheldon 
well she could have said goodbye 
okay i have a problem 
it s called carpal tunnel syndrome and quite frankly you deserve it 
what s wrong 
um well howard and christie are kind of hooking up in my bedroom 
are you sure 
look i grew up on a farm okay from what i heard they re either having sex or howard s caught in a milking machine do you mind if i stay here tonight 
no take the couch or my bed i just got new pillows hypo allergenics 
uh the couch is good 
hold that thought leonard a moment 
let me guess you have a problem with this 
where do i begin 
it s up to you crazy person s choice 
well first we don t have house guests frankly if i could afford the rent i d ask you to leave 
your friendship means a lot to me as well what else 
well our earthquake supplies we have a two day two man kit 
so 
so if there is an earthquake and the three of us are trapped here we could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon 
i m sorry are you suggesting that if we let penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism 
no one ever thinks it will happen until it does 
penny if you promise not to chew the flesh off our bones while we sleep you can stay 
hu what 
he s engaging in reductio ad absurdum it s the logical fallacy of extending someone s argument to ridiculous proportions and then criticising the result and i do not appreciate it 
i ll get you a blanket and a pillow 
okay well since i m obviously being ignored here let s go over the morning schedule i use the bathroom from 7 to 7 
how am i supposed to plan my bodily functions 
i suggest no liquids after 11pm 
here you go 
thanks leonard 
hmmph wrong 
i m listening 
your head goes on the other end 
why 
it s culturally universal a bed even a temporary bed is always oriented with the headboard away from the door it serves the ancient imperative of protecting oneself against marauders 
i ll risk it 
hm 
anything else i should know 
yes if you use my toothbrush i ll jump out that window please don t come to my funeral have a good night 
sorry about that 
that s okay 
fyi his toothbrush is the red one in the plexiglass case under the uv light 
got it 
well sleep tight 
thanks 
funny expression sleep tight it refers to the early construction of beds which featured a mattress suspended on interlocking ropes which would occasionally sleep tight 
what are you doing 
every saturday since we have lived in this apartment i have awakened at 6 
penny s still sleeping 
every saturday since we have lived in this apartment i have awakened at 6 
i know i know look you have a tv in your room why don t you just have breakfast in bed 
because i am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating mother s day 
uh what time is it 
almost 6 
i slept all day 
oh no it s 6 
what the hell is your problem 
okay this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity i now have a bowl of shredded wheat paste 
ola nerd migos 
why do you people hate sleep are you wearing my robe 
oh yeah sorry i ll have it cleaned 
that s okay keep it where s christie 
in the shower oh by the way where did you get that loofah mitt yours reaches places that mine just won t 
y you used my loofah 
more precisely we used your loofah i exfoliated her brains out 
you can keep that too 
ah well then we ll probably need to talk about your stuffed bear collection 
in here my lady 
chka chka chka chka chka chka chka 
well there s one beloved children s book i ll never read again 
leonard 
i m sheldon 
uh so christie what are your plans 
yeah no i meant plans to find some place to live other than with me not that i don t love having you but it s a little crowded 
penny you re always welcome to stay with us 
oh terrific now we re running a cute little b b 
let me offer a little outside the box thinking here why doesn t christie stay with me 
for one thing you live with your mother 
i do not my mother lives with me 
well then it s all settled christie will stay with howard penny can go back to her apartment and i ll watch the last 24 minutes of doctor who although at this point it s more like doctor why bother 
sheldon you just can t dictate 
no more talking everybody go 
so what do you say you wanna repair to castle wolowitz 
i m sorry i should have mentioned this earlier my last name is wolowitz 
i imagine there aren t many kosher corn huskers 
anything you want 
when they perfect human cloning i m going to order twelve of those 
howard can t you see she s using you 
who cares last night she pulled off her blouse and i wept 
look howard i know her okay she ll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things 
really 
yeah 
yay if you ll excuse me i have some bar mizvah bonds to cash 
i m sorry we cannot do this without wolowitz 
we can t order chinese food without wolowitz 
let me walk you through it our standard is the steamed dumpling appetizer general so s chicken beef with broccoli shrimp with lobster sauce and vegetable lo main do you see the problem 
i see a problem 
our entire order is predicated on four dumplings and four entrees divided among four people 
so we ll just order three entrees 
fine what do you want to eliminate and who gets the extra dumpling 
we could cut it into thirds 
then it is no longer a dumpling once you cut it open it is at best a very small open faced sandwich 
he s putting his needs ahead of the collective good where he comes from that s punishable by death 
can we get an order of dumplings but with three instead of four 
this isn t a substitution it s a reduction 
fine bring us three orders of dumplings that s twelve we ll each have four 
that works 
no if we fill up on dumplings we ll need to eliminate another entree 
if we have extra we ll just take the leftovers home 
and divide it how i m telling you we cannot do this without wolowitz 
wolowitz is with his new girlfriend if you had let me invite penny then you would have had your fourth 
have you seen penny eat chinese food she uses a fork and she double dips her egg rolls 
we don t order egg rolls 
exactly but we d have to if she was here 
can we please make a decision not only are there children starving in india there s an indian starving right here 
here s an idea why don t we just go out for indian food 
no 
uurgh 
i ll know 
how about soup 
yeah we can always divide soup 
what about the won tons 
oh hey guys what s up 
it s halo night 
yeah okay so 
well with wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend christie 
she s not my friend friends do not get their friends care bears all sweaty 
right anyway uh with wolowitz occupied elsewhere we had something we wanted to ask you sheldon 
yes penny we would very much appreciate it if you would be the fourth member of our halo team i don t think i need to tell you what an honour this is 
oh that s so sweet but i m going out dancing with a girlfriend 
you can t go out it s halo night 
well for penny it s dancing night 
you go dancing every wednesday 
no 
then it s not dancing night 
look why don t i play with you guys tomorrow 
tonight is halo night it s like talking to a wall 
alright now sheldon you and i are about to have a problem 
sheldon remember we role played this 
yes but you didn t portray her as completely irrational 
alright fellas i gotta go good luck 
maybe we should have asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend 
okay assuming we could dance which we can t there are three of us and two of them 
so 
it s the chinese restaurant all over again i assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is child s play compared with three men each attempting to dance with 67 of a woman 
aaah for god s sake sheldon you are driving me crazy 
your anger s not with me sir but with basic mathematics 
no i m pretty sure my anger s with you 
what s happening to us we re falling apart 
who are you calling 
the only man who can restore any semblance of balance to our universe 
hi this is howard wolowitz 
we can t get to the phone right now because we re having sex 
sheldon think this through you re going to ask howard to choose between sex and halo 
no i m going to ask him to choose between sex and halo 3 as far as i know sex has not been upgraded to include high def graphics and enhanced weapon systems 
you re right all sex has is nudity orgasms and human contact 
my point 
ladies ladies i m sure there s a middle ground 
you girl s talk i m going to take my scooter out for a little spin 
what are you guys doing here 
it s halo night 
so halo night huh 
i thought she was the whore of omaha 
shhh 
sheldon you got him in your sights fire he s charging his plasma rifle 
i can t shoot now i m cloaking 
now raj kill sheldon 
i can t see him 
that s why the call it cloaking dead man 
well then start throwing grenades 
i m all out 
hi guys my friends and i got tired of dancing so we came over to have sex with you 
that will do raj straight for the tank 
we said no tanks 
there are no rules in hell 
son of a bitch medpack i need a medpack 
told yah 
there s a sniper use your rocket launcher 
all i ve got is a needler and i m all out of ammo 
and now you re out of life why did you hit pause 
i thought i heard something 
what 
no never mind alright go 
damn you walletnook com 
problem 
the online description was completely misleading they said eight slots plus removable id to any rational person that would mean room for nine cards but they don t tell you the removable id takes up one slot it s a nightmare 
okay now do you really need the honorary justice league of america membership card 
it s been in every wallet i ve owned since i was five 
why 
it says keep this on your person at all times it s right here under batman s signature 
and this is leonard and sheldon s apartment 
guess whose parents just got broadband 
may i present live from new delhi dr and mrs v m koothrappali 
hi 
sorry papa 
hi 
and over here is sheldon 
hi 
he lives with leonard 
no no not like haroun and tanweer 
yeah we re not like haroun and tanweer 
papa please don t start 
okay that s my life that s my friends good to see you say goodbye 
what is it papa 
is it just me or does webchatting with your clothes on seem a little pointless 
the little fat girl that used to kick me in the samosas and call me untouchable 
why did you do that 
but papa i m not supposed 
spring wedding 
if you don t want to meddle then why are you meddling 
if i may your parents probably don t consider this meddling while arranged marriages are no longer the norm indian parents continue to have a greater than average involvement in their children s lives 
why are you telling me about my own culture 
you seemed confused 
sorry mommy papa but with all due respect i really can t go through 
i don t believe it 
neither do i doogie howser s been off the air for like twenty years 
actually i read somewhere that it s one of the most popular programmes in india 
it might speak to a cultural aspiration to have one s children enter the medical profession 
i bet you re right 
i bet they love scrubs 
what s not to love 
excuse me hello my parents are trying to marry me off to a total stranger what am i going to do 
i suggest you go through with it 
what 
romantic love as the basis for marriage has only existed since the nineteenth century up until then arranged marriages were the norm and it served society quite well 
it s the entire premise of fiddler on the roof 
i m not a big fan of musicals but i love that show 
me too of course it speaks to me culturally 
understandable but there s a universality to that story which transcends ethnicity 
let s not forget it s got some really catchy tunes 
okay i know what i m going to do 
what 
find new friends 
so who wants to rent fiddler 
no need we have the special edition 
well maybe we are like haroun and tanweer 
this is dr sheldon cooper yeah i need to cancel my membership to the planetarium yeah well i m sorry too but there s just no room for you in my wallet yeah i understand but it was between you and the museum of natural history and frankly you don t have dinosaurs well i ll miss you too bye bye okay i know you re texting about me and i d really like you to stop 
oh dear i am rightly and truly screwed 
hey i thought you were finding new friends 
i ve got some feelers out in the meantime listen to this 
can you believe how pushy she is 
so don t call her 
if i don t call her i won t hear the end of it from my parents 
so call her 
how can i call her you know i can t talk to women 
i m done anybody else 
give me the phone 
why 
just give it to me 
what are you doing 
don t worry you ll thank me you may now thank me 
for what making me sound like a simpsons character 
fine next time make your own date 
i didn t want to make this one 
look on the bright side she might turn out to be a nice beautiful girl 
great then we ll get married i won t be able to talk to her and we ll spend the rest of our lives in total silence 
worked for my parents 
hi guys 
oh hey 
i need some guinea pigs 
okay there s a lab animal supply company in reseda you could try but if your research is going to have human applications may i suggest white mice instead their brain chemistry is far closer to ours 
i swear to god sheldon one day i m going to get the hang of talking to you 
his mom s been saying that for years what s up 
well i finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bar tending shift so i need to practice making drinks 
oh great well the key to acquiring proficiency in any task is repetition 
with certain obvious exceptions suicide for example 
so leonard how about it 
look penny we d love to help you but raj is going through some stuff right now and besides he doesn t drink so really um raj is going through some stuff right now and he d like to take up drinking 
okay here you go leonard one tequila sunrise 
thank you this drink is a wonderful example of how liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical container thank you 
okay raj what ll it be 
whatever you recommend 
uh how about a grasshopper i make a mean grasshopper okay good coming up sheldon what are you going to have 
i ll have a diet coke 
okay can you please order a cocktail i need to practice mixing drinks 
fine i ll have a virgin cuba libre 
that s um rum and coke without the rum 
yes 
so coke 
yes and would you make it diet 
there s a can in the fridge 
a cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime wedge 
then swim to cuba 
bartenders are supposed to have people skills 
okay raj here you go alright who s next 
i d like to try a slippery nipple 
okay you re cut off anybody need a refill 
where did my life go penny one day i m a carefree batchelor and the next i m married and driving a minivan to peewee cricket matches in suburban new delhi 
a are you talking to me 
is there another penny here i had such plans i had dreams i was going to be the indira gandhi of particle astro physics but with a penis of course 
it s amazing 
ever since i was a little boy my father wanted me to be a gynaecologist like him how can i be a gynaecologist i can barely look a woman in the eye you know what i m not going to let my parents control my future any longer it s time for a showdown somebody give me a computer with a webcam 
okay sweetie i think that s the grasshopper talking 
and it s about to tell my parents that i m not riding an elephant down the aisle with lalita gupta 
okay calm down no one can make you get married why don t you just meet this girl and see what happens 
haven t you been listening to me i cannot talk to women 
um raj 
no no let s see how long it takes him 
um raj honey you say you can t talk to women but you ve been talking to me 
and now we ll never know 
you re right i i am talking to you hello penny how are you 
i m fine 
okay now i just need to make sure i have a lalita before i meet the grasshopper it s a sweet green miracle 
okay if you re going to drink on this date just promise me you won t overdo it 
overdo what happiness freedom this warm glow inside of me that promises everything is going to be all hunky donkey 
yeah that uh why don t you bring her to my restaurant when i m tending the bar so i can keep an eye on you 
okay 
wait a minute what s the plan here let s say he meets her and he likes her and they get married what s he going to do stay drunk for the rest of his life 
worked for my parents 
i can t believe i m sitting here next to little lalita gupta 
little lalita that s kind of fun to say little lalita little lalita little lalita you should try it 
you have lost so much weight that must have been difficult for you because you were so so fat do you remember 
of course you do who could forget being that fat 
so you re a dental student hmm are you aware that dentists have an extremely high suicide rate not as high as say air traffic controllers but then there are far more dentists than air traffic controllers so in pure numbers you re still winning 
you have a drink that ll make him less obnoxious 
drinks do not work that way 
i d say he was doing fine look at her last girl my mom set me up with had a moustache and a vestigial tail 
sorry i m late 
what happened 
nothing i just really didn t want to come virgin diet cuba libre please 
okay 
in a tall glass with a lime wedge 
oh i ll wedge it right in there 
so how s koothrappali d oh my lord 
what 
that s princess punchali 
i m pretty sure her name s lalita 
no no princess punchali from the monkey and the princess 
oh yeah i tried to watch that online but they wanted a credit card 
it s a children s story 
oh no it isn t 
when i was a little boy and got sick which was most of the time my mother would read it to me it s about an indian princess who befriends a monkey who was mocked by all the other monkeys because he was different for some reason i related to it quite strongly 
i know the reason 
we all know the reason sheldon what are you getting at 
that woman looks exactly like the pictures of princess punchali in the book how often does one see a beloved fictional character come to life 
every year at comic con every day at disneyland you can hire snow white to come to your house course they prefer it if you have a kid but 
hey guys this is lalita gupta lalita this is leonard and sheldon and howard and penny isn t it great she isn t fat any more 
forgive me your highness for i am but a monkey and it is in my nature to climb i did not mean to gaze upon you as you comb your hair 
you are the living embodiment of the beautiful princess punchali 
a beloved character from an indian folk tale 
you indian 
the resemblance is remarkable i can practically smell the lotus blossoms woven into your ebony hair 
i shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as i can 
but you re a dentist he s nuts 
it was said that the gods fashioned her eyes out of the stars and that roses were ashamed to bloom in the presence of her ruby lips 
back off sheldon 
what 
if you do not stop hitting on my lady you will feel the full extent of my wrath 
i m not hitting on her 
and you have no wrath 
you are my lady our parents said so we are for all intents and purposes one hundred percent hooked up 
exactly the kind of spirit with which princess punchali led the monkeys to freedom 
oh screw princess punchali 
but you re not princess punchali 
luckily for you she could have you beheaded 
i could eat 
what just happened 
beats the hell out of me 
i ll tell you what just happened i just learned how to pick up indian chicks 
maybe you should keep your eye on the ball papa 
doctor and mrs koothrappali in all fairness it wasn t entirely raj s fault 
no i m leonard 
but he s right papa listen to him you you are the one who ruined everything 
go ahead tell my parents why they won t have any grandchildren 
how would i know do you have a low sperm count 
this has nothing to do with my sperm count 
yes mommy 
can we please stop talking about my testicles sheldon tell them what you did 
what did i do 
you left with his date friends don t do that to each other 
oh alright noted sorry 
sorry that s all you can say is sorry 
take it raj it s more than i ve ever gotten 
and may i point out she wouldn t have asked me to go with her if you hadn t been drunk and boring 
and boring her words 
i m not an alcoholic 
it was just this one time papa i swear 
but papa please 
i have to go 
please wait until i get into the hall 
okay well good night 
hold on what happened with you and lalita 
we ate she lectured me on the link between gum disease and heart attacks nothing i didn t already know and i came home 
so you re not going to see her again 
why would i see her again i already have a dentist 
i wonder who s going to tell his parents they re not having grandchildren 
i don t believe it what s gotten into him 
oh maybe a couple of virgin cuba libres that turned out to be kind of slutty 
you didn t 
hey you do your experiments i do mine 
okay the x10s are online 
gentlemen i am now about to send a signal from this laptop through our local isp racing down fibre optic cable at the speed of light to san francisco bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to lisbon portugal where the data packets will be handed off to submerged transatlantic cables terminating in halifax nova scotia and transferred across the continent via microwave relays back to our isp and the x10 receiver attached to this 
look at me look at me i ve got goosebumps 
are we ready on the stereo 
go for stereo 
hey guys 
it s a little loud 
no problem turning it down et voila 
okay thanks 
hang on hang on do you not realise what we just did 
yeah you turned your stereo down with your laptop 
no we turned our stereo down by sending a signal around the world via the internet 
oh you know you can just get one of those universal remotes at radio shack they re really cheap 
no no no you don t get it um howard enable public access 
public access enabled 
boy that s brilliant but i ll see you 
no hang on hang on see 
no 
someone in sezchuan province china is using his computer to turn our lights on and off 
huh well that s handy um here s a question why 
they found the remote controlled cars 
well wait wait what s on top of them 
wireless webcams wave hello 
the monster truck is out of austin texas and the blue viper is being operated from suburban tel aviv 
you may want to put on slacks 
what ew stop it no leave me alone 
who s running the red corvette 
that would be me 
you know in the future when we re disembodied brains in jars we re going to look back on this as eight hours well wasted 
i don t want to be in a jar i want my brain in an android body eight feet tall and ripped 
i m with you i just have to make sure if i m a synthetic human i d still be jewish i promised my mother 
i suppose you could have your android penis circumcised but that s something your rabbi would have to discuss with the manufacturers 
not to mention you d have to power down on saturdays 
sheldon why is this letter in the trash 
well there s always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter but occam s razor would suggest that someone threw it out 
it s from the institute for experimental physics they want us to present our paper on the properties of super solids at the topical conference on bowes einstein condensates 
i know i read it before i threw it out 
okay if i may drill down to the bedrock of my question why did you throw it out 
because i have no interest in standing in the rose room of the pasadena marriott in front of a group of judgemental strangers who wouldn t recognise true genius if it were standing in front of them giving a speech which if i were there it would be 
i don t know sheldon those topical conferences on bowes einstein condensates parties are legendary 
forget the parties 
forget the parties what a nerd 
are there any other honours i ve gotten that i don t know about did ups drop off a nobel prize with my name on it 
leonard please don t take this the wrong way but the day you win a nobel prize is the day i begin my research on the drag co efficient of tassles on flying carpets 
hoo hoo hoo the only thing missing from that insult was yo mamma 
i ve got one hey leonard your mamma s research methodology is so flawed 
shut up howard sheldon we have to do this 
no we don t we have to take in nourishment expel waste and inhale enough oxygen to keep ourselves from dying everything else is optional 
okay let me put it this way i m doing it 
you can t i m the lead author 
oh come on the only reason you re the lead author is because we went alphabetically 
i let you think we went alphabetically to spare you the humiliation of dealing with the fact that it was my idea not to put too fine a point on it but i was throwing you a bone you re welcome 
excuse me i designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis 
it doesn t need proving 
so the entire scientific community is just supposed to take your word 
they re not supposed to but they should 
alright i don t care what you say i m going to the conference and i m presenting our findings 
and i forbid it 
you forbid it 
if i m not taking credit for our work then nobody is 
oh you admit that it s our work 
no once again i m throwing you a bone and once again you are welcome 
ah 
oh no he dit nt 
so how s it going with sheldon are you guys still not talking to each other 
not only is he still not talking to me but there s this thing he does where he stares at you and tries to get your brain to explode you know like in the classic sci fi movie scanners you know bzzz pchew never mind how about this one it says i know my physics but i m still a fun guy 
oh hey i didn t know they still made corduroy suits 
they don t that s why i saved this one 
okay well let s just see what else you have okay here take this and this and this and these 
is this all stuff you want me to try on 
no this is stuff i want you to throw out 
oh 
seriously don t even give it to charity you won t be helping anyone what s this 
oh that s the bottled city of kandor 
uh huh 
you see kandor was the capital city of the planet krypton it was miniaturised by brainiac before krypton exploded and then rescued by superman 
oh nice 
it s a lot cooler when girls aren t looking at it 
here why don t you put these on while i find a shirt and sport coat to match 
great be right back 
well where you going just put them on 
here 
oh are you shy 
no i m not shy 
don t worry i won t look 
i know you won t look why would you look there s nothing to see well not nothing 
sweetie put the pants on 
putting them on 
so you know isn t there maybe some way you and sheldon could compromise on this whole presentation thing 
no no scientists do not compromise our minds are trained to synthesise facts and come to inarguable conclusions not to mention sheldon is batcrap crazy 
what is this 
oh careful that s my original series battlestar galactica flight suit 
oh why didn t you wear it at halloween 
because it s not a costume it s a flight suit 
okay alright moving on oh wow a paisley shirt 
uh huh it goes with my corduroy suit 
if you mean it should end up in the same place then i agree is this your your only tie 
ah technically yes but if you ll notice it s reversible so it works as two 
oh sweetie i don t think it even works as one is this all your clothes 
yeah everything since the eighth grade 
the the eighth grade 
my last growth spurt 
okay well i guess we re back to the corduroy suit 
great 
yup i said no put it down 
hey sheldon 
hello penny 
get anything good 
uh just the latest copy of applied particle physics quarterly 
oh you know that is so weird that yours came and mine didn t yup tip your waitresses i m here all week 
penny just to save you from further awkwardness know that i m perfectly comfortable with the two of us climbing the stairs in silence 
oh yeah me too zip it lock it put it in your pocket so you and leonard 
oh dear god 
little misunderstanding huh 
a little misunder galileo and the pope had a little misunderstanding 
anyway i was talking to leonard this morning and i think he feels really bad about it 
huh 
well how do you feel 
i don t understand the question 
well i m just asking if it s difficult to be fighting with your best friend 
oh i hadn t thought about it like that i wonder if i ve been experiencing physiological manifestations of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil 
wait what 
i couldn t poop this morning 
you should just talk to him i m sure you guys can work this out 
it s certainly preferable to my plan 
which was 
a powerful laxative 
okay so you absolutely should talk to him look i know leonard values you as a friend and he told me himself that without your little idea there s no way he could have come up with this whole experiment thing 
excuse me little idea 
yeah i mean he tried to explain it to me i didn t really understand it but 
of course you didn t he said little idea 
uh well no no not in not in those words 
in what words then exactly 
um gee the exact words aren t written it s more the spirit in which it s 
what did he say 
you had a lucky hunch 
hey sheldon i ve been thinking instead of arguing about this why don t 
don t you ever speak to me again 
what 
uh he 
okay i m leaving for the conference 
have fun presenting my lucky hunch 
sheldon i didn t mean it like that 
then why did you say it 
i don t know i wasn t choosing my 
were you trying to impress penny 
no no not at all a little bit 
how d that work out for you 
leonard ready to go 
libido 1 truth zero 
okay i m going to ask you one more time we did the work together lets present the paper together 
and i m telling you for the last time it s pandering it s undignified and bite me 
let s go 
bye sheldon 
goodbye penny oooh one of these days pkshhhh 
there you go 
you re right this side does look better 
no no i didn t say better i said less stained 
i just checked the house there s probably twenty twenty five people in there 
you re kidding 
is that all 
all in particle physics twenty five is woodstock 
oh well then good 
i wasn t expecting such a crowd i m a little nervous 
it s okay just open with a joke you ll be fine 
a joke okay how about this um okay uh there s this farmer and he has these chickens but they won t lay any eggs so he calls a physicist to help the physicist then does some calculations and he says um i have a solution but it only works with spherical chickens in a vacuum right 
oh sorry i ve just i ve heard it before 
let s roll hey nice suit 
it s a classic right 
i really should have brought my own car 
so in conclusion the data show that at temperatures approaching absolute zero the moment of inertia changes and the solid becomes a super solid which clearly appears to be a previously unknown state of matter are there any questions 
any other questions 
i didn t skip it it s just an anecdote it s not science 
oh i see was the apple falling on newton s head was that just an anecdote 
you are not isaac newton 
no no that s true gravity would have been apparent to me without the apple 
you cannot possibly be that arrogant 
you continue to underestimate me my good man 
look if you weren t happy with my presentation then maybe you should have given it with me 
as i have explained repeatedly unlike you i don t need validation from lesser minds no offence 
really so why did you come 
because i knew you d screw this up 
i didn t screw it up 
oh please i admit that spherical chicken joke that was hilarious but it was straight downhill from there 
i ve had enough of your condescension maybe i didn t go to college when i was eleven like you maybe i got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16 but you are not the only person who is smarter than everyone else in this room no offense and i am clearly not the only person who is tormented by insecurity and has an ego in need of constant validation 
so you admit that you re an egotist 
yes my name is dr leonard hofstadter and i could never please my parents so i need to get all my self esteem from strangers like you but he s worse 
okay that is it 
you cannot blow up my head with your mind 
then i ll settle for an aneurysm 
stop it 
you hit me you saw him he hit me 
you were trying to blow up my head 
so it was working 
it wasn t it was not you are a nutcase 
oh we ll see about that heads up you people in the front row this is a splash zone 
stop stop it quit it 
is this usually how these physics things go 
more often than you d think 
vulcan nerve pinch 
you could have offered me a ride home 
you re lucky i didn t run you over 
i really don t understand what you re so unhappy about you begged me to come i came there s just no pleasing you 
you re right i m the problem i m the one that needs help 
well that s not much of an apology but i ll take it 
excuse me is there anything you d like to apologise for 
yes i m sorry i tried to blow up your head it was uncalled for 
you won t believe this 
somebody got the whole thing on a cell phone and put it on youtube 
what 
now who would do that 
that would be me hey check it out it s a featured video 
oh jeez is this suit really look that bad 
forget your suit look at my arms waving i m like a flamingo on ritalin 
howard would you like to explain to me why your facebook page has a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned me and my girlfriend 
uh oh here comes the talk 
see the liquid metal terminators were created in the future by skynet and skynet was developed by miles dyson but that future no longer exists due to dyson s death in terminator 2 
okay then riddle me this assuming all the good terminators were originally evil terminators created by skynet but then reprogrammed by the future john connor why would skynet an artificial computer intelligence bother to create a petite hot 17 year old killer robot 
skynet is kinky i don t know 
artificial intelligences do not have teen fetishes 
alright oh wait they use it to in 
too late i win 
let s go oh oh ou oooo ut tonight i have to go oh oh oh ou ooooo ut tonight 
what the hell is that 
i don t know but if cats could sing they d hate it too 
what oh we just had to mail some letters and 
you ll never guess what just happened 
oh i give up 
i don t guess as a scientist i reach conclusions based on observation and experimentation although as i m saying this it occurs to me you may have been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot 
what was that 
believe it or not personal growth what happened 
alright remember when i auditioned for that workshop production of rent but i didn t get it and i couldn t figure out why 
i have a conclusion based on an observation 
no you don t no he doesn t 
well the girl they picked to play mimi she dropped out and they asked me to replace her 
oh congratulations what a lucky break 
it s not a big deal just a one night showcase but they invite a lot of casting people and agents so you never know 
i think i know 
no you don t he doesn t 
it s this friday at eight you guys want to come 
because uh friday we are attending a symposium on molecular positronium 
i think that s a week from tuesday at six 
no it s this friday at eight 
oh too bad well i got to get to rehearsal see you guys 
see you 
you just lied to penny 
yes i did 
and you did it so casually no rapid breathing no increase in perspiration 
so 
so lack of a physiological response while lying is characteristic of a violent sociopath 
sheldon are you worried about your safety 
no i imagine if you were going to kill me you d have done it a long time ago 
that s very true 
leonard 
what 
i need to speak to you 
it s two o clock in the morning 
it s important 
i highly doubt that go away are you still out there 
yes 
what 
you re right it can wait until morning 
what what what what what 
never mind i clearly woke you up in the middle of a rem cycle you re in no state to talk 
sheldon what is it 
i m uncomfortable having been included in your lie to penny 
what was i supposed to say 
you could have told her the truth 
that would have hurt her feelings 
is that a relevant factor 
yes 
then i suppose you could have agreed to go 
and what would i have said afterwards 
i would suggest something to the effect of singing is neither an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you and if you disagree i d recommend you have a cat scan to look for a tumour pressing on the cognitive processing centre of your brain 
i couldn t say that i would have to say you were terrific and i can t wait to hear you sing again 
why 
it s the social protocol it s what you do when you have a friend who s proud of something they really suck at 
i was not aware of that 
well now you are 
oh alright leonard 
yes 
when we played chess earlier you were terrific and i can t wait to play you again goodnight 
oooaw this would be so much easier if i were a violent sociopath what 
i was analysing our lie and i believe we re in danger of penny seeing through the ruse 
how 
simple if she were to log on to www socalphysicsgroup org activities other click on upcoming events scroll down to seminars download the pdf schedule and look for the seminar on molecular positronium well then bippidy boppidy boo our pants are metaphorically on fire 
well sir my trousers will not be igniting today 
good morning 
do you have any idea what time it is 
of course i do my watch is linked to the atomic clock in boulder colorado it s accurate to one tenth of a second but as i m saying this it occurs to me that once again your question may have been rhetorical 
what do you want 
remember how leonard told you we couldn t come to your performance because we were attending a symposium on molecular positronium 
i remember symposium 
yes well he lied 
wait what 
he lied and i m feeling very uncomfortable about it 
well imagine how i m feeling 
hungry tired i m sorry this really isn t my strong suit 
you told her i lied why would you tell her i lied 
to help you 
i m sorry i m not seeing the help 
she was going to see through your lie eventually so i told her that you were lying to protect me 
oh i m getting a bad feeling 
hunger indigestion i m sorry i m really not very good at this anyway penny now believes that on friday night we re going to participate in my cousin leopold s drug intervention 
your cousin leopold 
yea who most people call leo but he also answers to lee remember that it s important 
what s important 
details leonard the success or failure of our deceitful enterprise turns on details 
do you have a cousin leopold 
no i made him up i think you d call him lee 
i don t get it i already told her a lie why replace it with a different lie 
well first of all your lie was laughably transparent where mine is exquisitely convoluted while you were sleeping i was weaving an un unravelable web 
un unravelable 
yes if she googles leopold houston she ll find a facebook page an online blog depicting his descent into drug use and a desperate yet hopeful listing on e harmony com 
okay why would i go to a drug intervention for your cousing 
ah because it s in long beach and i don t drive 
we re going to long beach 
no of course not there s no cousin leo there s no intervention focus leonard 
oh come on 
we just leave the house on friday night and we return in the wee hours emotionally wrung out from the work of convincing leo to go back into rehab 
so he goes back into rehab 
yes but he can relapse if penny ever invites us to go hear her sing again 
you still told her i lied 
for a noble purpose to spare me the social embarrassment of having a drug addled first cousin which i m assuming is embarrassing yes 
i don t know how am i supposed to remember all of this 
that s the best part you don t have to see i told penny that you would be embarrassed if you knew that she found out that you had lied so she s agreed to operate as if the original lie was still in force 
so she s expecting me to lie about going to a symposium in pasadena when in actuality we re pretending to go to a drug intervention in long beach 
un unravelable 
oh hey penny wow look at you all ready for your showcase you look great 
thanks i just wanted to come by and wish you guys luck with your symposium 
oh well thankyou 
you know i got to tell you a lot of friends would let their friend go alone but that s not who you are you are the kind of guy who stands by a friend when when he has a symposium to go to 
i don t know what to say 
it s okay leonard 
oh okay alright good 
oh boy group hug 
uh huh 
uh huh 
uh huh 
okay so what s up 
well uh penny is on her way to perform in a one night showcase production of rent which we are unable to attend because we are going to a symposium on molecular positronium given by dr emile farminfarmian 
wait a minute farminfarmian is speaking and you re bogarding the symposium 
howard i m sorry we re we re 
no no you re quark blocking us 
i don t know what to say 
wow 
howard listen 
no it s okay it s your millenium falcon you and chewbacca do whatever you want to do me and princess leia here will find some other way to spend the evening 
howard wait sheldon i think we should tell them 
okay sure i don t see a problem with that 
there s no symposium leonard lied to me isn t that right leonard 
well i don t know what to say 
it s okay i do look leonard is helping sheldon through a family crisis he made up the whole story about the symposium with dr farmin farm ian 
good for you 
hah yeah because he didn t want sheldon to be embarrassed and there is nothing to be embarrassed okay every family in america has a relative holed up in a garage somewhere huffing paint thinner 
no i m lost too i think she skipped a step 
no look sheldon s cousin leo escaped rehab and he s in a motel 8 at long beach the whole family s going out for an intervention leonard is driving sheldon down there to help him through this because he s such a good man 
oh another hug thank you 
alright you guys good luck 
thanks penny 
yeah uh break a leg 
break a leg 
so road trip to long beach 
no we re not going to long beach 
why not 
because sheldon doesn t have a drug addicted cousin leopold 
oh too bad i ve always wanted to go to long beach 
it s a very nice community the queen mary is docked there once the largest ocean liner in the world it s now a hotel and restaurant where they host a surprisingly gripping murder mystery dinner 
sounds fun 
i m game 
shotgun 
no no no leonard gets nauseous unless he sits in front and even then it s iffy 
wait are we really going to long beach 
leonard 
let it go sheldon the murderer was the first mate whether it makes sense to you or not 
no that s the least of our worries i ve been doing some research on addiction both the biochemical and behavioural aspects and i think there s a problem with the current version of our lie 
what are you talking about it s fine she bought it it s over 
sadly it s not substance abuse is a lifelong struggle but beyond that i have realised that the leo i described would not have agreed to go to rehab 
why not 
because leo is a middle child 
there is no leo how can you say that 
you didn t read the bio did you he s not just a middle child he s the quintessential middle child from a broken home to boot psychologically speaking the attention he gets by rebelling even to the point of self destruction is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab 
i ve got a solution 
great what is it 
get out 
fine we ll talk in the morning 
who are you 
oh god sheldon does not have a cousin leo 
excuse me we just went over this as the quintessential middle child your addiction is rooted in your unmet need for attention 
for your information this is all based on solid research stick with the character profile i wrote for you 
sheldon 
i m sorry leonard this is toby loobenfeld he s a research assistant in the particle physics lab but he also minored in theatre at mit 
yeah i got it sheldon why 
well you see while leo would not have gone into rehab it is completely plausible that we would have talked him into leaving the motel and coming home with us 
oh 
no we re going with middle child and a generic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production 
subtextually of course morning penny 
hi how did the intervention go 
unfortunately we weren t able to convince him to go to rehab 
well based on what you told me i m not surprised 
but we did convince him to leave the motel come say hello leo this is penny our friend and neighbour 
hi leo how are you feeling 
no 
well that s leo hey um why don t you tell me about your showcase last night 
oh it was okay i guess wasn t a big turn out but they both really seemed to like it 
there were only two people there 
by the end yeah 
i m i m sorry 
don t forget his genetic predisposition towards addiction 
there have been studies 
how could there be a double blind study who would be the control group 
as you can see detoxing can get pretty ugly let s give them some privacy 
yeah hey do you want to come over to my place have coffee 
sounds good 
i have a video of me singing last night do you want to see it 
gee why wouldn t i 
this is even better than you coming to the showcase because now i get to watch you watch me 
yeah funny how things work out 
your parents made the right decision 
leo you are a very sweet really funny guy you re gonna do okay 
how long is he going to stay here 
he s a homeless drug addict leonard where is he going to go boy you have a lot to learn about lying 
checkmate 
o o o o h again 
obviously you re not well suited for three dimensional chess perhaps three dimensional candyland would be more your speed 
just reset the board 
it must be humbling to suck on so many different levels 
hi guys 
hey 
did you get my mail 
yeah right here how was nebraska 
oh better than north dakota i guess that joke s only funny in nebraska 
from the data at hand you really can t draw that conclusion all you can say with absolute certainty is that that joke is not funny here 
boy it s good to be back 
how was your family 
ugh it was the worst trip everyone got sick over the weekend 
sick 
here we go 
what kind of sick 
oh the flu i guess 
i don t need you to guess i need you to know now when did the symptoms first appear 
maybe friday 
friday was that morning or afternoon 
i i don t 
think woman who blew their nose and when 
sheldon relax she doesn t have any symptoms i m sure she s not contagious 
oh please if influenza was only contagious after symptoms appear it would have died out thousands of years ago somewhere between tool using and cave painting homo habilus would have figured out to kill the guy with the runny nose 
penny you ll have to excuse sheldon he s a bit of a germophobe 
oh it s okay i understand 
thanks for your consideration now please leave 
you d better go before he starts spraying you with lysol 
okay well thank you for getting my mail 
no problem welcome home 
what 
what the hell are you doing 
i m making petrie dishes to grow throat cultures 
with lime jello 
i need a growth medium and someone polished off the apricot yoghurt here swab my throat 
i don t think so 
leonard if i m going to get ahead of this thing i need to find out what s growing in my throat 
sheldon you are not sick this is but you are not 
we have no idea what pathogen typhoid penny has introduced into our environment and having never been to nebraska i m fairly certain that i have no cornhusking antibodies 
sheldon don t you think you re overreacting 
when i m lying comatose in a hospital relying on inferior minds to cure me these jello cultures and my accompanying notes will give them a fighting chance 
i m going back to bed 
wait put this in the bathroom 
what for 
i need to measure my fluid intake and output to make sure my kidneys aren t shutting down 
i mix pancake batter in this 
no that measuring cup has always been for urine 
you had time to make a label for everything in this apartment including the label maker but you didn t have ten seconds to make one that said urine cup 
it s right here on the bottom 
huh i guess i owe the betty crocker company a letter of apology 
oh dear god leonard leonard i m sick 
leonard leonard i m sick 
hey 
leonard where are you 
i m at work 
at six thirty in the morning 
yes 
on sunday 
yes 
why 
they asked me to come in 
well i didn t hear the phone ring 
they texted me 
well as i predicted i am sick my fever has been tracking up exponentially since 2am and i am producing sputum at an alarming rate 
no kidding 
no not only that it has shifted from clear to milky green 
alright well get some rest and drink plenty of fluids 
what else would i drink gasses solids ionised plasma 
drink whatever you want 
i want soup 
then make soup 
we don t have soup 
i m at work sheldon 
is that a dog 
yes 
in the lab 
yes they re training dogs to operate the centrifuge for when they need dogs to operate the centrifuge for blind scientists i have to go 
i know it s the phone ma i hear the phone 
i don t know 
how can i ask them when i m talking to you hello 
howard it s leonard code milky green 
dear lord not milky green 
affirmative with fever 
it s leonard 
sheldon s sick 
for god s sake ma i m twenty six years old 
chocolate milk and eggoes please 
howard listen to me 
hang on call waiting 
no don t don t 
hello 
howard i m sick 
howard s sleeping this is his mother why are you calling at this ungodly hour 
i need soup 
then call your own mother it was sheldon 
i tried to stop you 
it s my own fault i forgot the protocol we put in place after the great ear infection of 06 
you call koothrappali we need to find a place to lay low for the next eighteen to twenty four hours 
stand by ma can my friends come over 
that s a negatory but there s a planet of the apes marathon at the new art today 
five movies two hours apiece it s a start 
no just crazy sheldon what are you doing here 
i m sick thank you very much 
how could you have gotten it from me i m not sick 
you re a carrier all these people here are doomed you re doomed 
shhh sheldon what do you want 
i want soup 
penny i have an iq of 187 don t you imagine that if there were a way for me to have had soup at home i would have thought of it 
you can have soup delivered 
i did not think of that clearly febrile delirium is setting in please bring me some soup while i still understand what a spoon is for 
okay what kind of soup do you want 
well my mother used to make me this split pea with little frankfurter slices and these home made croutons 
we have chicken tortilla and potato leek 
can i get any of those with little frankfurter slices and home made croutons 
no 
then surprise me would you call that moss green or forest green 
look at this everyone went chimp 
well i d like to point out i voted for orang utan but you shouted me down 
oh hi penny 
hey where are you 
i m uh at work 
you sound funny 
i m uh in a i m in a radiation suit what s up 
yeah well i m at work too and you ll never guess who s here infecting my entire station 
he won t leave he says he s afraid he ll pass out on the bus and someone will harvest his organs 
he s paranoid and he s established a nest 
can you please come get him 
uh yeah i d be i d be happy to penny i feel really guilty 
you did what you had to do 
take your stinking paws off my popcorn you damn dirty ape 
thanks for bringing me home 
oh it s okay i didn t really need to work today it s not like i have rent or car payments or anything 
good good 
okay well you feel better 
wait where are you going 
um home to write some bad cheques 
you re going to leave me 
sheldon you are a grown man haven t you ever been sick before 
well of course but not by myself 
really never 
well once when i was fifteen and spending the summer at the heidelberg institute in germany 
studying abroad 
no visiting professor anyway the local cuisine was a little more sausage based than i m used to and the result was an internal blitzkrieg with my lower intestine playing the part of czechoslovakia 
and there was no one there to take care of you 
no no my mum had to fly back to texas to help my dad because the house had slipped off the cinderblocks again 
again 
it was tornado season and it was an aluminium house anyway the housekeeper in the faculty residence didn t speak any english when i finally managed to convince her i was sick she said m chtest du eine darmsp lung 
what does that mean 
based on what happened next i assume it means would you like an enema 
okay sweetie i ll take care of you what do you need 
well my mom used to give me sponge baths 
okay ground rules no sponge baths and definitely no enemas 
agreed 
here we go ten and a half hours of apey goodness 
oh dammit my glasses okay i m blind here guys can you help me find them 
sorry found em 
oh great 
sorry don t you have a spare 
yeah at home 
well if you leave now you can be back before the gorillas rip the crap out of charlton heston 
unless sheldon s there in which case you ll be trapped forever in his whiny hyper neurotic snot web 
how about lasic 
you want me to get eye surgery 
would you rather go back to the apartment and deal with sheldon or have a stranger carve out your corneas with a laser beam 
well 
i m thinking 
okay nice and cosy okay i ll see you later 
wait will you please rub this on my chest 
oh sheldon can t you do that yourself 
vaporub makes my hands smell funny 
but sheldon 
please please please please please please please 
i can t believe i m doing this 
no no counter clockwise or my chest hair mats 
sorry 
can you sing soft kitty 
what 
my mom used to sing it to me when i was sick 
i m sorry honey i don t know it 
i ll teach you soft kitty warm kitty little ball of fur happy kitty sleepy kitty purr purr purr now you 
soft kitty warm kitty 
little ball of fur keep rubbing 
little ball of fur 
what do you see what do you see 
the living room appears to be empty 
okay he must be in his bedroom my spare glasses are in my bedroom on my dresser next to my bat signal 
i m not going in there 
raj 
no way jose 
well i can t do it i can t see anything 
it s all right wireless mini cam and bluetooth headset we ll be your eyes 
fine 
one more thing this is a subsonic impact sensor if sheldon gets out of bed and starts to walk this device will register it and send a signal to the laptop at that point based on the geography of the apartment and the ambulatory speed of a sick sheldon you ll have seven seconds to get out glasses or no glasses 
won t my footsteps set it off 
no you ll be on your hands and knees now you ll need to get the sensor as close as you can to sheldon s room 
well how do i carry it if i m on my hands and knees 
stay low bear left now keep true 
what 
it means go straight 
then just say go straight 
you don t stay go straight when you re giving bearings you say keep true 
alright i just hit my head 
because you didn t keep true okay turn right 
the the picture s breaking up 
angle your head to the right a little more a little more that s it now just keep true alright you re close enough to sheldon s room deploy the sensor now turn it on 
it wasn t on 
no 
then why did i have to crawl 
oh i guess you didn t 
okay it s on 
good from this point forward you will have to crawl 
i know 
hang on the sensor s picking up something turn your head back 
you rat bastard 
told you the sensor would work 
hi 
you deliberately stuck me with sheldon 
well i had to you see what he s like 
penny penny i m hungry 
uh it s okay sweetie good news leonard s home 
no 
here you go good luck bye 
w wait 
leonard i m hungry 
wait penny take me with you 
i want grilled cheese 
do you think penny will come here and take care of us 
i don t think penny s ever coming here again 
i m very congested 
yeah so 
can you go to the kitchen and get me the turkey baster labelled mucus 
if i stand i ll vomit 
under the sink yellow tupperware bowl 
here s the problem with teleportation 
lay it on me 
assuming the device could be invented which would identify the quantum state of matter of an individual in one location and transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly you would not have actually transported the individual you would have destroyed him in one location and recreated him in another 
how about that 
personally i would never use a transporter because the original sheldon would have to be disintegrated in order to create a new sheldon 
would the new sheldon be in any way an improvement on the old sheldon 
no he would be exactly the same 
that is a problem 
so you see it too 
graduate work very impressive 
not bad i myself started graduate school at fourteen 
advantage kim 
excuse me that is my research and it is by no means a dead end 
yes sir 
you can count on us we re on it what the hell do you mean dead end 
i sense a disturbance in the force 
a bad feeling i have about this mmm hmmm 
so dennis how long have you been in america 
no kidding you speak english really well 
what are you talking about 
he s not wrong alright and this is my office 
nope goodbye 
come on sheldon we ve hardly shown him anything 
oh alright this is my desk these are my books this is my door please close it behind you goodbye 
keen observation goodbye 
leonard 
huh yeah 
get him out 
come on dennis i ll show you the rec centre they ve got nautilus equipment 
not heavy ones 
you think i haven t considered it you really think i haven t considered it 
get him out leonard 
come on dennis i ll show you the radiation lab 
yes in fact i am the youngest person ever to win it 
fourteen and a half 
it s like looking into an obnoxious little mirror isn t it 
hey i m damaged too how about a hug for howie 
sure raj hug howard 
uh uh uh 
something you d like to share a tale of woe perhaps 
fifteen years old dennis kim is fifteen years old and he s already correcting my work today i went from being wolfgang amadeus mozart to you know that other guy 
antonio salieri 
oh god now even you re smarter than me 
you know sheldon you don t have so many friends that you can afford to start insulting them 
just eat sheldon you ll feel better 
why waste food in texas when a cow goes dry they don t keep feeding it they just take her out and shoot her between the eyes 
i m confused did sheldon stop giving milk 
you can t let this kid get to you you always knew that someday someone would come along who was younger and smarter 
yes but i assumed i would have been dead hundreds of years and that there would be an asterisk by his name because he would be a cyborg 
so you ve got a bit of competition i really don t see what the big deal is 
well of course you don t you ve never excelled at anything 
i don t understand exactly how did he get any friends in the first place 
we liked leonard 
well what are you going to do sheldon give up 
yes that s what a rational person does when his entire life s work is invalidated by a post pubescent asian wunderkind he ceases his fruitless efforts he donates his body to scientific research and he waits to die 
you know i m confused again is he waiting or do we get to shoot him between the eyes 
hey 
hey 
i ve decided you re right my career is not over 
great 
but since the arrival of dennis kim has rendered my research pointless i just have to find something else to focus on 
great 
so i ve decided i m going to collaborate with you 
great 
what exactly is it you do i know you chatter on about it all the time but i ve never really paid attention 
okay well right now i m designing an experiment to study the soft component of cosmic radiation at sea level but i really don t need any help 
oh sure you do now see what s this here in the schematic is that a laser array 
yes 
no hmmm what happens if you use argon lasers instead of helium neon 
it would blow up 
are you sure 
pretty sure 
pretty sure s not very scientific is this how you normally work just hunches and guesses and stuff 
okay sheldon i understand that you re going through a bit of a career crisis you re searching for some other area where you can feel valuable and productive but i need to tell you something and i want you to listen carefully 
alright 
go away 
if you re concerned about sharing credit with me you re name can go first i m going 
so this is engineering huh 
i ll talk to you later 
engineering where the noble semi skilled labourers execute the vision of those who think and dream hello oompah loompahs of science 
sheldon what are you doing here 
i just came by to say hello 
i ve been at this lab for three years you ve never came by to say hello 
well up until now i ve had better things to do so what are we making today 
a small payload support structure for a european science experimental package that s going up on the next space shuttle 
really how does it work 
when this is done it will be attached to the payload bay and the sensor apparatus will rest on it 
uh huh so it s a shelf 
no you don t understand during acceleration it needs to stay perfectly level and provide yeah okay it s a shelf 
now i notice you re using titanium did you give any consideration to carbon nanotubes they re lighter cheaper and half twice the tensile strength 
sheldon there s a diploma in my office that says i have a masters in engineering 
and you also have a note from your mother that says i love you bubbula but neither of those is a cogent argument for titanium over nanotubes 
sheldon 
yes 
go away 
did leonard tell you to say that 
no i thought of it all by myself 
huh it can t be a coincidence there must be some causal link i m missing 
go away 
curiouser and curiouser 
is he here 
if he were i wouldn t be 
do you know what he did he watched me work for ten minutes and then started to design a simple piece of software that could replace me 
is that even possible 
as it turns out yes 
something s got to be done about him leonard 
like what he ll never be able to cope with the fact that some fifteen year old kid is smarter and more accomplished than he is 
well what if something were to happen to this boy so he was no longer a threat to sheldon 
then our problem would be solved 
hang on are we talking about murdering dennis kim i m not saying no 
we don t have to go that far there are other means available 
we can t send him back to north korea he knows how to get out 
the only thing we need to do is make this kim kid lose his focus 
that won t happen he s not interested in anything but physics 
what about biology 
what 
you know biology the one thing that can completely derail a world class mind 
howard he s fifteen 
yeah so when i was fifteen i met denise polmerry and my grade point average fell from a 5 0 to a 1 8 
she was sleeping with you 
no i just wasted a lot of time thinking about what it would be like if she did 
oh hey guys what s up 
we need a hot fifteen year old asian girl with a thing for smart guys 
what 
howard that s racist any fifteen year old girl will do the trick 
it s possible she may have misunderstood us 
no no please come in yeah i think you ll appreciate this very exciting 
something remarkable since my prospects for the nobel prize in physics have disappeared thank you very much i ve decided to refocus my efforts and use my people skills to win the nobel peace prize look i m going to solve the middle east crisis by building an exact replica of jerusalem in the middle of the mexican desert 
you know it s like the baseball movie build it and they will come 
the jewish people 
we ll make it nice put out a spread 
of course he has the oracle told us little neo was the one you can see the matrix can t you 
ah la la la hava nagila they ll come they ll settle and i ll win the prize 
i really don t understand your objections professor goldfarb why wouldn t the senoran desert make a perfectly good promised land 
we could call it nuevo cherusalem 
said pharoah to moses 
it s take your daughter to work day 
oh yes there was a very official email that was sent to everyone whose insurance files indicated they had daughters between the ages of 14 and 16 
smooth 
thank you 
okay so we now have a socially awkward genius in a room full of attractive age appropriate women 
all he has to do now is hook up with one of them 
does anyone else see the flaw in this plan 
we need a social catalyst 
like what we can t get fifteen year old girls drunk 
or can we 
no we can t 
i don t think you mean we can t i think you mean we shouldn t 
hey howard you re a jew if there was another wailing wall exactly like the one in jerusalem but close to taco stands and cheap prescription drugs would you still be able to wail at it okay it s definitely me 
okay we cannot leave this to chance lets pick a girl and figure out how to get her together with dennis 
okay how about that one 
uh uh i know the type cheerleader student council goes out with jocks won t even look at anybody in the gifted programme and if after two years of begging she does agree to go out with you it turns out to be a set up and you re in the back seat of your mom s car with your pants off while the whole football team laughs at you 
are you crying 
no i have allergies 
okay uh how about her 
sure if he wants to spend a couple of years doing her homework while she drinks herself into a stupor with non fat white russians while you re the one holding her head out of the toilet while she s puking and telling you she wishes more guys were like you and they she gets into cornell because you wrote her essay for her and you drive up to visit her one weekend and she acts like she doesn t even know you 
okay so not her either how about her 
interesting kind of pretty a little chubby so probably low self esteem 
i think that s our girl one of us should go talk to her 
i can t talk to her you do it 
i can t just go up and talk to her howard you talk to her 
oh no she ll never go for the kid once she gets a peek at this 
you know if we were in india this would be simpler five minutes with her dad twenty goats and a laptop and we d be done 
well we re not in india 
alright why don t we do it your way then we ll arrange for this girl to move in across the hall from dennis so he can pathetically moon over her for months on end 
okay that was uncalled for 
you started it dude 
welcome dennis kim 
youngest till the cyborgs rise up 
the kid got a girl 
unbelievable 
did anyone see how he did it 
don t worry i ve got this ladies and gentlemen honoured daughters while mr kim by virtue of his youth and naivety has fallen prey to the inexplicable need for human contact let me step in and assure you that my research will go on uninterrupted and that social relationships will continue to baffle and repulse me thank you 
he s back 
yeah mission accomplished 
forget the mission how did that little yutz get a girl on his own 
i guess times have changed since we were young smart is the new sexy 
well why do we go home alone every night we re still smart 
maybe we re too smart so smart it s offputting 
yeah let s go with that 
unbelievable components i built are on the international space station and i get a ticket for launching a model rocket in the park 
i don t know if the ticket was so much for the launch as it was for you telling the policewoman you have to frisk me i have a rocket in my pants 
hey look at that it s dennis kim 
wow i almost didn t recognise him 
you know i kind of feel bad about what we did to him 
yeah we really ruined his life 
screw him he was weak 
ooh more details about the new star trek film there s going to be a scene depicting spock s birth 
i d be more interested in a scene depicting spock s conception 
oh please for vulcans mating or if you will pon farr it s an extremely private matter 
still i d like to know the details his mother was human his father was vulcan they couldn t just conceive 
maybe they had to go to a clinic imagine spock s dad in a little room with a copy of pointy ears and shapely rears 
how come on star trek everybody s private parts are the same no alien lady ever told captain kirk hey get your thing out of my nose 
hi can you help me i was writing an email and the a key got stuck now it s just going aaaaaaa 
what did you spill on it 
nothing diet coke and yoghurt a little nail polish 
i ll take a look at it 
gentlemen switching to local nerd news fishman chen chowdry mcnair aren t fielding a team in the university physics bowl this year 
you re kidding why not 
they formed a barbershop quartet and got a gig playing knotsbury farm 
wow so in your world you re like the cool guys 
recognise 
this is our year with those guys out the entire physics bowl will kneel before zod 
zod 
kryptonian villain long story 
good story 
well count me out 
what why 
you want me to use my intelligence in a tawdry competition would you ask picasso to play pictionary would you ask noah webster to play boggle would you ask jacques cousteau to play go fish 
come on you need a four person team we re four people 
by that reasoning we should also play bridge hold up a chuppah and enter the olympic bobsled competition 
i want tickets to that please 
sheldon what do i need to quote spock s dying words to you 
no don t 
the needs of the many 
outweigh the needs of the few 
or the one dammit i ll do it 
okay first order of physics bowl business we need a truly kick ass team name suggestions 
how about the perpetual motion squad it s beyond the laws of physics plus a little heads up for the ladies 
the ladies 
perpetual motion squad we can go all night 
i like it 
i don t teams are traditionally named after fierce creatures thus intimidating ones opponent 
then we can be the bengal tigers 
poor choice gram for gram no animal exceeds the relative fighting strength of the army ant 
maybe so but you can t incinerate a bengal tiger with a magnifying glass 
let s put it to a vote all those in favour 
point of order i move that any vote on team names should be unanimous no man should be forced to emblazon his chest with the bengal tiger when common sense dictates it should be an army ant 
will the gentleman from the great state of denial yield for a question 
i will yield 
after we go through the exercise of an annoying series of votes all of which the gentleman will lose does he then intend to threaten to quit if he does not get his way 
he does 
i move we are the army ants all those in favour 
good afternoon and welcome to today s physics bowl practice round i m penny and i ll be your host because apparently i didn t have anything else to do on a saturday afternoon and isn t that just a little sad gentlemen are you ready 
yes 
of course 
fire away 
you know it s none of my business but isn t a guy who can t speak in front of women going to hold you back a little 
oh uh he ll be okay once the women are mixed into the crowd he only has a problem when they re one on one and smell nice 
oh thanks raj it s vanilla oil 
i was actually the one who noticed okay let s just start 
okay the first question is on the topic of optics what is the shortest light pulse ever produced dr cooper 
and of course the answer is 130 adoseconds 
that is correct 
i knew that too 
good for you sweetie okay next question what is the quantum mechanical effect used to encode data on hard disk drives howard 
and of course the answer is giant magneto resistance 
right 
hey i buzzed in 
but i answered it s called teamwork 
don t you think i should answer the engineering questions i am an engineer 
by that logic i should answer all the anthropology questions because i m a mammal 
just ask another one 
okay what artificial satellite has seen glimpses of einsteins predicted frame dragging 
and of course it s gravity probe b 
sheldon you have to let somebody else answer 
why 
because it s polite 
what do manners have to do with it this is war were the romans polite when they salted the ground of carthage to make sure nothing would ever grow again 
leonard you said i only had to ask questions 
the objective of the competition is to give correct answers if i know them why shouldn t i give them 
some of us might have the correct answers too 
oh please you don t even have a phd 
alright that s it 
howard sit down 
okay 
maybe we should take a little break 
good idea i need my wrist brace all this button pushing is aggravating my old nintendo injury 
i agree 
what did he say 
he compared sheldon to a disposable feminine cleansing product one might use on a summer s eve 
yeah and the bag it came in 
leonard excellent i want to show you something 
can it wait i need to talk to you 
just look i ve designed the perfect uniforms for our team the colours are based on star trek the original series the three of you will wear support red and i will wear command gold 
why do they say aa 
army ants 
isn t that confusing aa might mean something else to certain people 
why would a physics bowl team be called anodised aluminium 
no i meant never mind hey check it out i got you a batman cookie jar 
oh neat what s the occasion 
well you re a friend and you like batman and cookies and you re off the team 
what 
howard raj and i just had a team meeting 
no you didn t 
yes we did i just came from it 
okay i don t know where you just came from but it couldn t have been a team meeting because i m on the team and i wasn t there ergo the team did not meet 
okay let me try it this way uh i was at a coffee klatch with a couple of friends and one thing led to another and it turns out you re off the team 
why 
because you re taking all the fun out of it 
well i m sorry is the winner of the physics bowl the team that has the most fun 
okay let me try it this way you re annoying and no one wants to play with you any more 
i see well at this point i should inform you that i intend to form my own team and destroy the molecular bonds that bind your very matter together and reduce the resulting particulate chaos to tears 
thanks for the heads up 
you re welcome one more thing 
yes 
it s on bitch 
so who d he get to be on his team 
he won t say he just smiles and eats macaroons out of his bat jar 
he s using psychological warfare we must reply in kind i say we wait until he looks at us then laugh like yes you are a smart and strong competitor but we are also smart and strong and we have a reasonable chance of defeating you 
how exactly would that laugh go 
hee hee hee hee hee hee hee 
that sounds more like we are a tall thin woman who wants to make a coat out of your dalmatians 
guys let s remember that sheldon is still our friend and my room mate 
so 
so nothing let s destroy him 
gentlemen 
hee hee hee hee hee hee hee 
okay we re going to need a strong fourth for our team 
you know who s apparently very smart is the girl who played tv s blossom she got a phd in neuroscience or something 
raj we re not getting tv s blossom to join our physics bowl team 
how about the girl from the wonder years 
gentlemen i believe i ve found the solution to all our problems 
we can t ask leslie winkle 
why because you slept together and when she was done with you she discarded you like last night s chutney 
yes 
sometimes you ve got to take one for the team 
yeah sack up dude 
fine here i go taking one for the team in the sack hey leslie 
leslie i have a question for you and it might be a little awkward you know given that i 
hit that thang 
there s not gee cos it sure sounds like there should be 
that s all very comforting but if it s okay i d like to get on with my question now 
we are entering the physics bowl and we need a fourth for our team 
dilepton schmilepton we need you 
well we tried just have to face sheldon mano e mano e mano a mano 
yes 
she s in 
so how do you feel nice and loose come to play got your game face on are you ready 
oh yeah you know you don t have to stay for the whole thing 
oh no no i want to it sounds really interesting 
gentlemen 
sheldon 
sheldon 
hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee 
sheldon i m just going to sit down 
so is that your team 
actually i don t need a team i could easily defeat you single handedly but the rules require four so may i introduce the third floor janitor he lady from the lunchroom and my spanish is not good either her son or her butcher and what about your team what rat have you recruited to the ss sinking ship 
leslie winkle 
yes well i m polymerised tree sap and you re non organic adhesive so whatever verbal projectile you launch in my direction is reflected off of me returns on its original trajectory and adheres to you 
here s your tee shirt 
no it stands for perpetual motion squad 
all night long y all 
the eta meson 
formal protest 
the velcro on my wrist brace caught on my shirt 
and of course the answer is technetium 
sheldon can suck on the casimir effect 
4 1855 times ten to the seventh ergs per calorie 
prevost s theory of exchanges 
lamda equals one over pi r squared n 
760 degrees celsius the approximate temperature of the young lady in the front row 
a sigma particle 
holy crap 
what the hell is that 
it looks like something they found on the ship at roswell 
come on think leslie 
you re never going to let that go are you 
sorry i panicked 
then guess 
um eight point four 
he doesn t have it he s got squat 
hang on hang on a second that s not our answer what are you doing 
how do you know anything about physics 
well that s a delightful little story but our arrangement was that you sit here and not say anything i answer the questions 
hey look now maybe you have democracy now in your beloved russia but on this physics bowl team i rule with an iron fist ow 
well it s not what he said 
i want a different question 
formal protest 
informal protest 
no i decline to provide one 
that s your opinion 
hang on sheldon is proving that you are single handedly smarter than everyone else so important that you would rather lose by yourself than win as part of a team 
i don t understand the question 
go ahead 
sorry somebody s sitting there 
who 
my physics bowl trophy 
that trophy is meaningless i forfeited therefore you did not win 
i know someone who would disagree 
who 
my physics bowl trophy leonard is so smart sheldon who 
alright that is very immature 
you re right i m sorry i m not 
okay new contest 
what are you doing 
i m settling once and for all who is the smartest around here okay are you ready 
absolutely 
bring it on 
okay marsha jan and cindy were the three daughters of what tv family the brady bunch okay sammy hagar replaced david lee roth as the lead singer in what group 
the brady bunch 
van halen alright madonna was married to this ridgemont high alum oh my god sean penn 
how do you know these things 
i go outside and i talk to people alright here what actor holds the record for being named people magazine s sexiest man alive 
william shatner

formal protest 
alright singer who sang oops i did it again okay tweetie bird taught he taw a what 
romulan 
yes he taught he taw a romulan 
well this sandwich is an unmitigated disaster i asked for turkey and roast beef with lettuce and swiss on wholewheat 
what did they give you 
turkey and roast beef with swiss and lettuce on wholewheat it s the right ingredients but in the wrong order in a proper sandwich the cheese is adjacent to the bread to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce they might as well have dragged this thing through a car wash 
i don t believe it 
i know it s basic culinary science 
some guy is auctioning off a miniature time machine prop from the original film and no one is bidding on it 
a time machine from the movie the time machine 
no a time machine from sophie s choice 
boy sophie could have used a time machine in that movie did you see it it s rough 
oh that s cool 
uh huh 
it s only 800 
yeah and that s my bid 
you bid 800 
it was a spur of the moment thing i figured it would go for thousands and i just wanted to be a part of it 
there s only 30 seconds left in the auction 
do you have 800 
not to blow on a miniature time machine 
don t worry the way these things work there s people waiting til the last second to bid and then they swoop in and get it it s called sniping 
fifteen seconds 
come on snipers 
ten nine eight 
where are your snipers 
five 
snipe 
four 
snipe 
three 
snipe 
two 
snipe 
one 
aaaa aw 
congratulations you are the proud owner of a miniature time machine 
you lucky duck 
i wonder why no one else bid this is a classic piece of sci fi movie memorabilia 
yeah i know i still can t afford it 
why don t we share it we ll each put in two hundred bucks and we ll take turns having it in our homes 
a time share time machine i m in sheldon 
need you ask but i still don t understand why no one else bid 
i understand why no one else bid 
did the listing actually say miniature 
i just assumed who sells a full sized time machine for 800 
in a venn diagram that would be an individual located within the intersection of the sets no longer want my time machine and need 800 
it s actually a tremendous bargain even with shipping it works out to less than four dollars a pound 
cocktain shrimp are 12 50 
how are we going to get it upstairs 
if we take the dish off it might fit in the elevator 
yes but the elevator s been broken for two years 
i ve been meaning to ask you do you think we should make a call about that 
not necessary i have a masters in engineering i remotely repair satellites on a regular basis i troubleshoot space shuttle payloads when the mars rover started pulling to the left i performed a front end alignment from 62 million miles away no that baby s broken 
come on guys push 
if i push any harder i m going to give birth to my colon 
i can t feel my fingers hurry up 
it s the same amount of work no matter how fast you go basic physics 
sheldon 
yeah 
if my fingers ever work again i ve got a job for the middle one 
oh hey guys 
what are you doing 
oh just you know moving something upstairs 
what is it 
it s you know time machine 
yeah okay neat but i really got to get to work so 
uh just give us a few minutes 
i don t have a few minutes i m running really late 
then i have a simple solution go up to the roof hop over to the next building there s a small gap don t look down if you re subject to vertigo and use their stairwell 
you re joking right 
oh i never joke when it comes to vertigo 
damn okay i ll just take the roof 
hey if you wait for us to set up the time machine i can drop you off at work yesterday time travel joke it s not never mind 
for what it s worth i thought it was humorous 
let s just do this guys ready to push 
in a minute howard stepped outside to throw up 
i don t know what you were worried about i think it really works in the room 
yeah it is by far the coolest thing i have ever owned 
the exact time machine that carried actor rod taylor from victorian england into the post apocalyptic future which society had splintered into two factions the sub terranean morlocks who survived by feasting on the flesh of the gentle surface dwelling eloy 
talk about your chick magnets 
oh yeah the guy who lives next to me is always like i have a jacuzzi on my balcony i have a jacuzzi on my balcony but wait until i tell him i ve got a time machine on my balcony stuff that in your speedos jacuzzi bob 
gentlemen i know we said we d take turns but i think you d agree that practicality dictates it remain here 
you can t just keep it here what if i meet a girl and say you wanna come up and see my time machine it s at my friends house how lame is that 
he s got a point 
alright i think we re going to need some ground rules in addition to the expected no shoes in the time machine and no eating in the time machine i propose that we add pants must be worn at all times in the time machine 
seconded 
i was going to put down a towel 
i still want it on my balcony i say we move it on a bi monthly basis 
that sounds fair 
hold on bi monthly is an ambiguous term do you mean move it every other month or twice a month 
twice a month 
then no 
okay every other month 
no 
sheldon you can t be selfish we all paid for it so it belongs to all of us now out of the way so i can sit in my time machine okay i am setting the dials for march 10th 1876 
good choice alexander graham bell invents the telephone and calls out for dr watson 
wait a minute i d want to see that too 
so when it s your turn you can 
but if we all go back to the same point in time bell s lab is going to get very crowded he ll know something s up 
also since the time machine doesn t move in space you ll end up in 1876 pasadena 
and even if you can make it to boston what are you going to do knock on the door and say to mrs bell hey mrs bell big fan of your husband can i come in and watch him invent the telephone 
mrs bell was deaf she s not even going to hear you knock 
oh i have a solution first go into the future and obtain a cloaking device 
ooh how far into the future 
if i remember correctly captain kirk will steal a cloaking device from the romulans on stardate 5027 3 which will be january 10th 2328 by pre federation reckoning 
okay i am setting the dials for january 10th 2328 here we go into the future that was fun 
my turn 
okay first of all what you call a gap was nearly three feet wide i slipped and skinned my knee 
are you okay 
zzz zz zz zz second of all the door to the stairwell of the other building was locked so i had to go down the fire escape which ends on the third floor forcing me to crawl through the window of a lovely armenian family who insisted i stay for lunch 
that doesn t sound too bad 
it was eight courses of lamb and they tried to fix me up with their son 
sorry 
not done by the time i finally got to work they d given my shift away yeah that s right i ve lost an entire day s pay thanks to this this 
time machine 
the lights flash and the dish spins you wanna try it 
no i don t want to try it my god you are grown men how could you waste your lives with these stupid toys and costumes and comic books and and now that that 
again time machine 
oh please it s not a time machine if anything it looks like something elton john would drive through the everglades 
it only moves in time it would be worse than useless in a swamp 
pathetic all of you completely pathetic 
my turn 
leonard it s two in the morning 
so 
so it s my turn why did you set it for the day before yesterday 
because i want to go back and keep myself from getting a time machine 
you can t if you were to prevent yourself from buying it in the past you would not have it available in the present to travel back and stop yourself from buying it ergo you would still have it this is a classic rookie time travel mistake 
can i go back and prevent you from explaining that to me 
same paradox if you were to travel back in time and say knock me unconscious you would not then have the conversation that irritated you motivating you to go back and knock me unconscious 
what if i knocked you unconscious right now 
it won t change the past 
but it would make the present so much nicer 
are you upset about something 
what was your first clue 
well it was a number of things first the late hour then your demeanour seems very low energy plus your irritability 
yes i m upset 
oh i don t usually pick up on those things good for me 
yeah good for you 
oh wait did you want to talk about what s bothering you 
i don t know maybe 
wow i m on fire tonight 
uh here s the thing girls like penny never end up with guys who own time machines 
i disagree your inability to successfully woo penny long predates your acquisition of the time machine that failure clearly stands on its own 
thanks for pointing it out 
in addition your premise is flawed in the original film rod taylor got yvette mimeaux with that very time machine in back to the future marty mcfly got the opportunity to hook up with his extremely attractive young mother 
those are movies 
well of course they re movies were you expecting me to come up with an example involving a real life time machine that s absurd 
come on guys push 
if i push any harder i m going to give birth to my colon 
oh hey guys 
what are you doing 
oh just you know moving a time machine 
yeah okay neat but i really got to get to work so 
no problem 
but what about your time machine 
some things are more important than toys 
oh i m scared 
don t worry baby i ve got you 
oh leonard 
it s still my turn 
what are you doing 
i m packing up all my collectibles and taking them down to the comic book store to sell 
well is that really necessary if you need money you can always sell blood and semen 
it s not about money 
we brought food 
lox and bagels the breakfast of time travellers 
terrific does anyone want to buy my share of the time machine 
why 
because i don t want it any more 
why 
just personal reasons 
my spidey sense tells me this has something to do with penny 
look do you want to buy me out or not 
i ll give you a hundred dollars which will make me half owner and we ll put it on my balcony 
screw his balcony i ll give you a hundred and twenty and we ll put it in my garage 
i paid two hundred dollars for my share 
dude everyone knows a time machine loses half its value the minute you drive it off the lot 
i ll go for two hundred that time machine stays right where it is 
three hundred and i ll throw in my original 1979 mattel millenium falcon with real light speed sound effects 
no no more toys or action figures or props or replicas or costumes or robots or darth vader voice changers i m getting rid of all of it 
you can t do that look what you ve created here it s like nerdvana 
more importantly you ve a darth vader voice changer 
not for long 
oh i call dibs on the golden age flash 
hang on i need that to complete my justice society of america collection 
too bad i called dibs 
well you can t just call dibs 
i can and i did look up dibs on wikipedia 
dibs doesn t apply in a bidding war 
it s not a bidding war i m selling it all to larry down at the comic book store 
why larry did larry call dibs 
will you forget dibs 
he offered me a fair price for the whole collection 
what s the number i ll match it 
i ll match it plus a thousand rupees 
what s the exchange rate 
none of your business take it or leave it 
mom my bar mizvah bonds how much do i got thanks i can go twenty six hundred dollars and two trees in israel 
forget it guys if i sell to one of you the other two are going to be really mad at me 
who cares as long as you pick me 
okay leonard put down the box let s talk 
sorry raj my mind is made up 
no i can t let you do this 
sheldon get out of my way 
none shall pass 
okay i did not want to do this but i have here the rare mint condition production error star trek 
okay man be cool we re all friends here 
what the hell s going on 
you hypocrite 
what 
little miss grown ups don t play with toys if i were to go into that apartment right now would i find beanie babies are you not an accumulator of care bears and my little ponies and who is that japanese feline i see frolicking on your shorts hello hello kitty 
okay okay look if this is about yesterday leonard i am really sorry about what i said i was just a bit upset 
no i needed to hear it 
no you didn t look you are a great guy and it is things you love that make you who you are 
i guess that makes me large breasts 
still i think it s time for me to get rid of this stuff and you know move on with my life 
really 
yeah 
oh wow good for you 
thanks hey do you want to i don t know later 
hi mike 
yeah i just have to change 
oh stop it bye guys 
my turn on the time machine 
it worked it really worked they said i was mad but it worked 
sheldon are you okay 
we have to get rid of the time machine 
it is a little big for the living room isn t it 
yeah that s the problem it s too big 
i m glad you agree i hired some guys to help us move it come on in fellas 
oh no morlocks eat him eat him aaaaargh leonard 
on the other hand some physicists are concerned that if the super collider actually works it will create a black hole and swallow up the earth ending life as we know it 
psh what a bunch of crybabies no guts no glory man 
hey check it out the school of pharmacology is looking for volunteers 
we are testing a new medication for social anxiety panic attacks agoraphobia and obsessive compulsive disorder why would they be looking for test subjects here 
i don t know raj maybe the comic book store doesn t have a bulletin board what s going on 
shhh hot girl in sheldon s office 
sheldon s office is she lost 
don t think so i followed her here from the parking lot 
maybe she s his lawyer 
well she s free to examine my briefs 
howard 
i know i m disgusting i should be punished by her oh look i did it again 
thank you for coming by hello 
oh hey buddy 
buddy 
sorry i m late i m working on a project that may take me up on the next space shuttle 
how can you be late i wasn t expecting you at all 
nobody ever expects me sometimes you just look and bam howard wolowitz 
sheldon are you going to introduce us 
oh alright this is missy missy this is leonard and rajesh and you ve already met howard 
you too swell also 
yeah 
so how do you two know each other 
excuse me 
she s my twin sister she thinks she s funny but frankly i ve never been able to see it 
how exactly would one measure a sense of humour a humourmometer 
well i think you re delightfully droll or as the french say tres drole 
rajesh 
so missy what brings you all the way from texas 
was it perhaps destiny i think it was destiny 
destiny thy name is anaheim 
the papers could have been mailed mom just sent you here to spy on me didn t she 
they call me a genius because i m a genius tell mom that i currently weigh 165 pounds and that i m having regular bowel movements enjoy the wedding goodbye 
if the wedding s not until tomorrow why don t you stay with us tonight 
they were not friends they were imaginary colleagues 
look you re here we have plenty of room 
no we don t 
come on shelly she s family 
so what i don t issue invitations to your mother 
and don t ever call me shelly 
so it s settled you ll stay with us 
i ll walk you to your car you re in structure 3 level c right 
what just happened 
hee hee just classic 
i needed a place to fire ceramic semi conductor substrates for home made integrated circuits 
made necessary by her insistence on going into my room 
ha ha not your eyebrows 
is that what that was i just assumed that the second grade curriculum had rendered you quizzical 
hey leonard you left your underwear in the dryer downstairs 
those are not mine 
really they have your little name label in them 
yeah no i do i use those uh just to polish up my spear fishing equipment i spear fish when i m not crossbow hunting i spear fish uh penny this is sheldon s twin sister missy missy this is our neighbour penny 
wow you don t look that much alike 
can i get a hallelujah 
fraternal twins come from two separate eggs they are no more alike than any other siblings 
hallelujah 
hey guess what i ve been accepted as a test subject for a new miracle drug to overcome pathological shyness 
hey good for you raj 
yes i m very hopeful hello missy they mentioned there may be side effects 
so missy have you ever met a man from the exotic subcontinent of india 
ah yes dr patel good man 
do you like motorcycles cos i ride a hog 
a hog you have a two cylinder scooter with a basket on the front 
you still have to wear a helmet 
have you ever heard of the kama sutra 
the indian sex book in other words if you wonder wonder who wrote the book of love it was us 
hey sheldon s sister s pretty cute i w 
i wasn t staring 
i didn t say you were i just said she was cute 
oh huh um maybe if you like women who are tall and perfect 
sheldon why are you ignoring your sister 
i m not ignoring my sister i m ignoring all of you 
i brought snacks 
onion dip it s onion dip 
we don t entertain much 
missy do you enjoy pajamas 
we indians invented them you re welcome 
yeah well my people invented circumcision you re welcome 
missy i m going to go get my nails done do you want to come 
you re welcome 
bye missy 
bye missy see you 
goodbye leonard 
uh yeah no uh bye penny 
okay you two have to back off 
why should i back off you back off dude 
excuse me this is my apartment and she s my roommate s sister 
so what you ve already got penny 
how do i have penny in what universe do i have penny 
so i can have penny 
hell no 
excuse me can i interject something i m ordering pizza online is everyone okay with pepperoni 
sheldon can i talk to you in private 
i guess don t worry i was going to order you cheeseless 
thank you 
that s okay lactose intolerance is nothing to be embarrassed about 
i m a fancy indian man we invented pajamas 
hey look at me i don t have a foreskin 
sheldon are you aware that your sister is an incredibly attractive woman 
hmmm she certainly has the symmetry and low body fat that western culture deems desirable it s noteworth that at other points in history heavier women were the standard for beauty because their girth suggested affluence 
that s fascinating but i 
i didn t say it was fascinating i said it was noteworthy 
alright noted but my point is that koothrappali and wolowitz they re hitting on your sister 
oh okay you know i don t want to criticise your rhetorical style but we d be a lot further along in this conversation if you d begun with that thought 
that s great but i 
what i m saying is that we took quite an unnecessary detour from what i now understand to be your thesis 
whatever you have to do something about it 
why 
because she s your sister 
i don t understand yes we shared a uterus for nine months but since then we ve pretty much gone our own separate ways 
okay uh oh consider this with your father gone it is your responsibility to make sure that missy chooses a suitable mate 
i hadn t considered that we do share dna 
uh huh 
so there is the possibility however remote that resting in her loins is the potential for another individual as remarkable as myself 
exactly and you owe it to yourself and to posterity to protect the genetic integrity of your sister s future offspring 
you re right if someone wants to get at missy s fallopian tubes they ll have to go through me 
i am shiva the destroyer i will have the woman 
i m warning you i was judo champion at math camp 
alright that s enough juvenile squabbling stop it stop it i say i m going to settle this right now neither of you are good enough for my sister 
who are you to decide that 
he s the man of his family you have to respect his wishes 
you re out too by the way 
say what 
it s nothing personal i d just prefer if my future niece or nephew didn t become flatulent every time they eat an eskimo pie 
what are you so happy about 
i m not happy it s the medication i can t stop smiling 
now that leonard s made me aware of how high the genetic stakes are we have to face the fact that none of you are suitable mates for my sister 
wait a minute leonard made you aware of that 
we all make mistakes let s move on 
excuse me but i think you re missing a big opportunity here 
how so 
everybody knows genetic diversity produces the strongest offspring why not put a little mocha in the family latte 
in principle you have a point but as a practical matter need i remind you that it takes experimental pharmaceuticals to simply enable you to speak to the opposite sex 
is it cause i m jewish cause i d kill my rabbi with a porkchop to be with your sister 
this has nothing to do with religion this has to do with the fact that you re a tiny tiny man who still lives with his mother 
sheldon you are really being unreasonable 
am i here eat this cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister 
oops 
why does everyone suddenly want to talk to me alone usually nobody wants to be alone with me 
we all make mistakes let s move on 
truthfully i ve never given it any thought but it has been pointed out to me that you carry dna of great potential 
let me explain you see i m a superior genetic mutation an improvement on the existing mediocre stock 
that would be you but residing within you is the potential for another me perhaps even taller smarter and less prone to freckling a sheldon 2 0 if you will 
exactly now i am not saying that i should be the sole decider of who you mate with if you re not attracted to the suitor then the likelihood of conception would be reduced 
not at all frequent coitus dramatically increases the odds of fertiliziation 
i always thought i was more like a cuckoo bird you know a superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds of course the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death luckily for you that s where the metaphor ended 
i have an alternate proposal 
you donate eggs we will place them in cryogenic storage i will find an appropriate sperm donor for your eggs have them fertilized and implanted in you that way everybody wins 
correction missy can date whoever she wants 
look we have to settle this 
i agree sheldon s sister is hiding at penny s because we ve all been hitting on her at the same time 
she s not hiding she needed privacy to call her grandmother who s apparently very sick oh and then i believe she has to wash her hair 
oh you poor deluded bastard 
don t start with me dude 
you want to go again let s go 
sit down 
okay 
if we re going to fight over missy let s do it the right way the honourable way 
and he s down 
come on come on get up 
stay down bitch yeah ha ha natural selection at work 
i weep for humanity 
excuse me while i go tell missy the good news 
ah hey leonard 
hi penny how s it going listen that guy mike that you were dating is that still going on 
uh pretty much why 
nothing just catching up by the way may i speak to missy please 
of course 
well since you re leaving tomorrow i was wondering if you d like to go out to dinner with me 
oh you have other plans or 
oh alright uh enjoy the rest of your evening 
um here s something we didn t anticipate 
what do you want howard 
i m fine thanks for asking i ve come to call on missy 
missy 
the amazing howard do you like magic 
then you are in for a treat behold an ordinary cane 
okay 
missy 
thank you i apprec apprec appreeee oh oh 
oh honey is your medication wearing off 
well she might be interested to know that i have refocused my research from bosonic string theory to heteronic string theory 
okay well it was pleasant seeing you other than that business with my testicles 
really 
you tell people i m a rocket scientist 
i m a theoretical physicist 
what s the difference 
my god why don t you just tell them i m a toll taker at the golden gate bridge rocket scientist how humiliating 
hey guys guys some of the other waitresses wanted me to ask you something 
oh it s called trestling 
it combines the physical strength of arm wrestling with the mental agility of tetris into the ultimate sport 
yeah that s terrific but what they wanted me to ask you was to cut it the hell out happy birthday to you happy birthday to you 
we might as well stop it s a stalemate you re beating me in tetris but you ve got the upper body strength of a keebler elf 
keebler elf i ve got your keebler elf right here okay it s a stalemate 
so leonard will we be seeing you on saturday for your free birthday cheesecake 
he can t eat cheesecake he s lactose intolerant 
okay he can have carrot cake 
what about the cream cheese frosting 
he can scrape it off 
forget about the cake how did you know that my birthday is saturday 
i did your horoscope remember i was going to do everybody s until sheldon went on one of his typical psychotic rants 
for the record that psychotic rant was a concise summation of the research of bertram forer who in 1948 proved conclusively through meticulously designed experiments that astrology is nothing but pseudo scientific hokum 
blah blah blah a typical taurus so seriously are we going to see you saturday 
oh i don t think so 
why not 
i don t celebrate my birthday 
shuddup yeah you do 
no it s no big deal it s just the way i was raised my parents focussed on celebrating achievements and being expelled from a birth canal was not considered one of them 
uh that s so silly 
it s actually based on very sound theories his mother published a paper on it 
what was it called i hate my son and that s why he can t have cake 
it was obviously effective leonard grew up to be an experimental physicist perhaps if she d also denied him christmas he d be a little better at it 
thank you 
well i love birthdays waking up to mom s special french toast breakfast wearing the birthday king crown playing laser tag with all my friends 
yeah see that s what kids should have 
actually that was last year 
so you ve really never had a birthday party 
no but it was okay i mean when i was little i d think maybe my parents would change their mind and surprise me with a party like this one birthday i came home from my cello lesson and i saw a lot of strange cars parked out front and when i got to the door i could hear people whispering and i could smell german chocolate cake which is my favourite 
and 
uh it turns out my grandfather had died 
oh my god that s terrible 
oh it was kind of like a birthday party i got to see all my cousins and there was cake so 7 
that s the saddest thing i ve ever heard 
you think go ahead tell her about your senior prom 
make sure they remember no peanuts 
howard every thai restaurant in town knows you can t eat peanuts they see me coming they go ah no peanut boy 
hello penny leonard just left 
i know i want to talk to you 
what would we talk about we ve no overlapping areas of interest i m aware of and you know i don t care for chit chat 
okay can you just let me in 
well alright but i don t see this as a promising endeavour 
okay here s the deal we are going to throw leonard a kick ass surprise party for his birthday on saturday 
i hardly think so leonard made it very clear he doesn t want a party 
did someone say party 
he just doesn t know he wants one because he s never had one 
i suppose that s possible but for the record i ve never had a threesome and yet i still know i want one 
howard here s the difference the possibility exists that leonard could have a birthday party before hell freezes over 
fine if i do have a threesome you can t be part of it i m just kidding yes you can can you bring a friend 
i think a birthday party is a terrible idea i envy leonard for growing up without that anguish 
anguish 
year after year i had to endure wearing conical hats while being forced into the crowded sweaty hell of bouncy castles not to mention being blindfolded and spun towards a grotesque tailless donkey as the other children mocked my disorientation 
okay sweetie i understand you have scars that no non professional can heal but nevertheless we are going to throw leonard a birthday party 
have i pointed out that i am extremely uncomfortable with dancing loud music and most other forms of alcohol induced frivolity 
nevertheless we are 
in addition i really don t think that leonard wants a 
okay here s the deal you either help me throw leonard a birthday party or so help me god i will go into your bedroom and i will unbag all of your most valuable mint condition comic books and on one of them you won t know which i ll draw a tiny happy face in ink 
you can t do that if you make a mark on a mint comic book it s no longer mint 
sheldon do you understand the concept of blackmail 
well of course i oh yeah i have an idea let s throw leonard a kick ass birthday party 
that s not the secret knock this is the secret knock 
what difference does it make 
the whole point of a secret knock is to establish a non verbal signal to verify the identity of one s co conspirators 
is that raj and howard 
possibly but unverified 
can you just let us in 
luckily for you this is not a nuclear reactor 
so what did you get the birthday boy 
well raj got him an awesome limited edition dark knight sculpture based on alex ross s definitive batman and i got him this amazing autographed copy of the feynman lectures on physics 
nice i got him a sweater 
okay well he might like that i ve seen him chilly 
uh sheldon i didn t see your present 
that s because i didn t bring one 
well why not 
don t ask 
the entire institution of gift giving makes no sense 
too late 
let s say that i go out and i spend fifty dollars on you it s a laborious activity because i have to imagine what you need whereas you know what you need now i can simplify things just give you the fifty dollars directly and you could give me fifty dollars on my birthday and so on until one of us dies leaving the other one old and fifty dollars richer and i ask you is it worth it 
told you not to ask 
well sheldon you re his friend friends give each other presents 
i accept your premise i reject your conclusion 
try telling him it s a non optional social convention 
what 
just do it 
it s a non optional social convention 
oh fair enough 
he came with a manual 
question how am i going to get leonard a present before the party i don t drive and the only things available within walking distance are a thai restaurant and a gas station i suppose i could wrap up an order of mee krob and a couple of lottery scratchers 
okay let s do this um i will drive sheldon to get a present and howard you need to get rid of leonard for about two hours 
no problem 
and then raj you bring the stuff across the hall and start setting up 
what if guests show up 
entertain them 
what if they re women 
stare at them and make them feel uncomfortable 
hey 
hey 
how s it going 
fine 
so listen the new art is showing the revised definitive cut of blade runner 
seen it 
no you ve seen the 25th anniversary final cut this one has eight seconds of previously unseen footage they say it completely changes the tone of the film 
oh pass 
come on afterwards there s a q a with harrison ford s body double 
look i am in the halo battle of my life here there s this kid in copenhagen he has no immune system so all he does is sit in his bubble and play halo 24 7 
can t you play him some other time 
not if you believe his doctors 
oh my god do you smell gas 
no 
yeah no 
alright you know they have dvds over there 
yes but they have dvd burners over here leonard needs a dvd burner 
sheldon a gift shouldn t be something someone needs it should be something fun you know something they wouldn t buy for themselves 
you mean like a sweater 
well it s a fun sweater it s got a bold geometric print 
is it the geometry that makes it fun 
okay the point is one of the ways we show we care about people is by putting thought and imagination into the gifts we give them 
okay i see so not a dvd burner 
exactly 
something he wouldn t buy for himself something fun something like oh an 802 11n wireless router 
here you go copenhagen boy how about a taste of hans christian hand grenade come on come on oh you clever little come on come on take that 
what s the matter 
this granola bar there s peanuts in it 
oh my god why did you eat it 
i don t know it was just there 
well if i had a gun there would you have shot yourself 
don t yell at me i ve got to go to the emergency room 
now 
no after my tongue has swollen to the size of a brisket 
alright um just uh let me get my keys 
oh god oh god oh god oh okay sheldon what was it supposed to be fine it s out of the washer i ll call you when it s in the dryer 
what do you think 
um that one 
because of the two additional ethernet ports 
sure 
he doesn t need them he s already got a 640 connect switch 
oh okay then this one 
why 
i don t know the man on the box looks so happy 
penny if i m going to buy leonard a gift i m going to do it right i refuse to let him experience the same childhood trauma i did 
oh i know i m going to regret this but what trauma 
on my twelfth birthday i really wanted a titanium centrifuge so you know i could separate radioactive isotopes 
of course 
instead of a titanium centrifuge my parents bought me wow this is hard they got me a motorised dirt bike 
no 
what twelve year old boy wants a motorised dirt bike 
all of them 
really 
yeah 
huh 
okay so we re getting this one 
yeah i suppose 
okay let s go 
i know everything about this stuff 
here buy this one look it s the one we re getting see happy guy available 
no no no no she doesn t want that she needs a point to point peer network with a range extender 
it depends on what bus you have 
oh dear lord 
sheldon we have to go 
not now penny this poor man needs me you hold on i ll be right with you what computer do you have and please don t say a white one 
excuse me 
no listen see we re throwing my friend a surprise party and i m supposed to keep him out of his apartment for two hours 
no see the only way i could get him to leave is to tell him i ate a peanut because i m allergic to peanuts 
look all i need from you is to take me in the back and give me a band aid so i can pretend i had a shot of epinephrine and they you tell my friend you need to keep me under observation for about an hour hour and a half 
yes 
no you don t understand 
okay i get it i know how the world works how about if i were to introduce you to the man who freed your people 
hey sorry i couldn t find a parking spot how are you doing 
bad very bad 
really cos you don t look like you re swelling up at all maybe we should just pick up some benedryl at the drug store and go home 
we can t go home 
why not 
becauth becauth th th brissket brissket water need water 
alright i ll be right back 
penny look i ve got a problem 
yeah well so do i look you ve got to stall leonard a little longer 
i don t think i can 
you have to we all have to be there at the same time to yell surprise 
okay you have to understand something we re in a hospital right now 
why is leonard okay 
leonard s fine i m fine thanks for asking by the way 
okay i don t need your attitude just hold him there a little longer 
look i ve done my best but he wants to go home and i don t know how to stop him 
okay how about this you keep him there a little longer and when you get to the party i ll point out which of my friends are easy 
don t toy with me woman 
i ve got a hot former fat girl with no self esteem i ve got a girl who punishes her father by sleeping around and an alcoholic who s two tequila shots away from letting you wear her like a hat 
thy will be done 
okay we don t have that in stock but i can special order it for you 
him 
yes well apparently neither does anyone else 
sheldon we have to go 
why 
well for one thing we re late for leonard s birthday party and for another i told him to call security 
keep walking 
yeah 1 2 3 4 is not a secure password 
excuse me my friend is having an allergic reaction to peanuts 
yes he is 
pees hep me 
fank u 
say what you will about the healthcare system in this country but when they re afraid of lawsuits they sure test everything 
i really don t think the colonoscopy was necessary 
you know before you got all swollen up i actually thought you were trying to keep me out of the apartment so you could throw me a surprise party 
oh right it s your birthday i had no idea it was your birthday i completely forgot wow what a lousy way to spend a birthday well it s all over now 
there is a party isn t there 
maybe 
howard 
are you mad 
how could i be mad you actually risked your life because you cared about me 
yeah that s why i did it 
alright here we go my first birthday party 
dude everybody left an hour ago surprise 
okay leonard here i am at your birthday party i don t know where you are dude but it s really kick ass everyone is very very drunk and uh oh look there s a girl taking her shirt off 
that s my friend carol remind me i ve got to introduce her to howard 
oh sweet krishna shake it that a rupee maker 
i m so sorry you didn t get your party 
oh it s okay 
happy birthday anyways 
hey penny when uh when s your birthday 
wo de zhing shi sheldon 
no it s wo de ming zi shi sheldon 
wo de ming zi shi sheldon 
what s this 
that s what you did i assumed as in a number of languages that the gesture was part of the phrase 
well it s not 
how am i supposed to know that as the teacher it s your obligation to separate your personal idiosyncrasies from the subject matter 
you know i m really glad you decided to learn mandarin 
why 
once you re fluent you ll have a billion more people to annoy instead of me 
hey 
mai du lui tsa 
you just called leonard a syphilitic donkey 
my apologies leonard i m only as good as my teacher 
why are you learning chinese 
i believe the szechuan palace has been passing off orange chicken as tangerine chicken and i intend to confront them 
if i were you i d be more concerned by what they re passing off as chicken 
i need to use your window 
oh yeah no sure go ahead 
what s going on 
oh i ll tell you what s going on that stupid self centred bastard wrote about our sex life in his blog 
okay where were we 
not now i have a blog to find 
penny are you okay 
i m fine leonard just go away 
look i understand that breaking up with someone can be very painful 
go away 
okay feel better bye she doesn t want to talk 
not surprising penny s emotional responses originate from the primitive portion of the brain known as the amygdala while speech is centred in the much more recently developed neocortex the former can easily overpower the latter giving scientific credence to the notion of being rendered speechless or maybe she just doesn t want to talk 
hey look i found an ipod 
it s smashed beyond repair what are you going to do with it 
what else sell it on ebay as slightly used 
it was penny s boyfriend s they broke up 
apparently he posted intimate details of their physical relationship on his blog which i cannot find anywhere 
you know what i m going to go back and try talking to her again 
good idea sit with her hold her comfort her and if the moment feels right see if you can cop a feel 
i m not going to do that howard 
i m not aware of any social convention that requires you to intervene at all 
what about damsel in distress 
twelfth century code of chivalry not exactly current you d also have to be knighted for that to apply 
i don t care she s upset i m going over there 
remember to sit on your hands a bit so they re warm 
i m her friend i m not going to take advantage of her vulnerability 
what so you re saying that if in the depths of despair she throws herself at you and demands you take her right there right now you ll just walk away 
i said i m her friend not her gay friend 
hey listen i know you said that you didn t want to talk 
i don t 
sorry 
wait 
wait did you say wait 
tell me the truth am i just an idiot who picks giant losers 
no no 
okay so i pick good guys but turn them into losers 
of course not 
well it s got to be one or the other which is it 
i m sorry what were the choices again 
i really thought mike was different i thought he was sensitive and smart i mean not you smart normal non freaky smart 
yeah no sure 
you know and then he just goes and has to humiliate me by writing about me on his blog so the entire world can read it 
actually it s not all that easy to find 
yeah really well my friends at work found it my sister found it judging by my email a number of prisoners at the michigan state penitentiary found it 
okay well what exactly did this guy write not that i need to know the details of your sex life i just thought never mind 
nope you know what you might as well read it everybody else has go ahead oh god i just feel so betrayed and embarrassed i just want to crawl into a hole and die 
okay well you know this isn t that bad it just paints the picture of a very affectionate woman who s open to expressing her affection in non traditional locales 
oh god 
elevators parks movie theatres out of curiosity is this subway the transportation system or subway the sandwich shop 
sandwich shop 
doesn t that violate the health code 
no at the sub shop we were only making out 
huh okay but my point is that you have absolutely no reason to be embarrassed 
really do you think i overreacted 
maybe a little 
cause i do that i do overreact maybe i should call mike and apologise 
no no no that that would be underreacting he did break the implied confidentiality of the bedroom and in your case the elevator parks and fast food franchise 
yes you re right i should just say i m done with him 
yes you should go ahead say it 
but i never gave the man a chance to explain 
what is there to explain it s all right here it s a betrayal 
no you were right the first time this is a man who loves me but in his own stupid way he was just trying to show people how he feels 
i m pretty sure i never said that 
no you did better than that you helped me see it on my own 
aw good for me where are you going 
i m going over to mike s leonard thank you so much 
oh sure huh maybe i am her gay friend 
howard i m going to need another mandarin lesson i obviously didn t make my point with those people 
for god s sake sheldon if you don t like the tangerine chicken don t order the tangerine chicken 
i like tangerine chicken i m not getting tangerine chicken 
can we please change the subject 
sure tell us again how you screwed up and got penny back together with her old boyfriend 
just roll the dice 
enslaved by warlocks stay here till you roll 2 4 or 6 7 
she was mad at him she was done with him the relationship was broken beyond repair and i walked over there and i fixed it 
boy that story gets better every time you hear it 
actually i thought the first two renditions were far more compelling previously i felt sympathy for the leonard character now i just find him to be whiny and annoying 
just eat your tangerine chicken 
i d love to but i don t have tangerine chicken 
incredible you managed to screw up the screw up 
i m back 
i m sorry i yelled at you it s not your fault 
what happened 
well i went over to mike s to make up with him 
yeah i know i know that part 
but he had already moved on 
already that was quick 
that s what i said to the woman who had her legs wrapped around his neck 
oh penny i am so sorry 
how could he do that 
oh well you know you did throw an 8 gig ipod yeah no how could he do that 
i swear to god i am done with guys like that you know macho with the perfect body and the hair and the money 
yeah that must get old quick 
you know just once i would like to go out with someone who is nice and honest and who actually cares about me 
what about me 
what about you what 
what about if you went out with me 
are you asking me out 
um yes i am asking you out 
wow 
i was just going off your comment about the nice guy 
no i know i got that yeah totally 
thing and honest but it s no big deal 
yes 
yes what 
yes i will go out with you 
really 
yeah why not i mean what do i have to lose 
yeah that s the spirit 
show me your citrus peels gei wo kan ni jud di zi pei show me your citrus peels gei wo kan ni jud di zi pei show me your 
sheldon 
aieee ya xia si wo le 
i m sorry look do you have a second 
a second what pair of underwear 
i was just wondering if i could talk to you it s about leonard 
why me why not koothrappali or wolowitz 
well raj can t talk to me unless he s drunk and wolowitz is you know disgusting 
yes i suppose he is 
all i m saying is you know leonard the best 
not necessarily i m often surprised by my lack of familiarity with leonard just the other day i discovered he not only has a loofah he hides it why do you suppose a man would be ashamed of having a loofah i myself prefer to have my excess epithelial cells slough off naturally but i don t condemn those who seek to accelerate the process 
leonard might come home can we talk in my apartment 
we re not done 
no 
ach why not we re already through the looking glass anyway 
okay so here s the thing i guess you re aware that leonard asked me out 
well he didn t actually say anything but when he came back to the apartment he was doing a dance that brought to mind the happy hippos in fantasia 
oh that s nice anyhow the thing i wanted to talk to you about is you know since leonard and i have become friends i was just want to sit down 
oh i wish it were that simple you see i don t spend much time here and so i ve never really chosen a place to sit 
well choose 
there are a number of options and i m really not familiar enough with the cushion densities air flow patterns and dispersion of sunlight to make an informed choice 
alright why don t you just pick one at random and then if you don t like it you can sit somewhere else next time 
no no that s crazy you go ahead and talk while i figure it out 
okay um here s the thing so i ve known for a while now that leonard has had a little crush on me 
a little crush well i suppose so in the same way menelaus had a little crush on helen of troy 
alright yeah i don t really know who they are 
well menelaus was the brother of agamemnon 
yeah i don t care i don t care the point is leonard isn t the kind of guy i usually go out with 
leonard isn t the kind of guy anyone usually goes out with would you be open to rotating the couch clockwise thirty degrees 
no what i m saying is leonard might be different in a good way obviously my usual choices have not worked out so well 
the last one worked out well for koothrappali he got a free ipod oh glare 
but on the other hand if things don t go well with leonard i risk losing a really good friend i mean i guess he s not looking for a fling he s the kind of guy that gets into a relationship for i don t know like you would say light years 
i would not say that no one would say that a light year is a unit of distance not time 
thank you for the clarification 
draft you see people hear the word year and they think duration foot pound has the same problem that s a unit of work not of weight 
right thanks 
it s a common mistake 
not the first one i ve made today 
okay i think this will be my seat 
sheldon do you have anything to say that has anything to do with you know what i m talking about 
well let s see we might consider schrodinger s cat 
schrodinger is that the woman in 2a 
no that s mrs grossinger and she doesn t have a cat she has a mexican hairless annoying little animal yip yip yip yip 
sheldon 
sorry you diverted me anyway in 1935 erwin schrodinger in an attempt to explain the copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics he proposed an experiment where a cat is placed in a box with a sealed vial of poison that will break open at a random time now since no one knows when or if the poison has been released until the box is opened the cat can be thought of as both alive and dead 
i m sorry i don t get the point 
well of course you don t get it i haven t made it yet you d have to be psychic to get it and there s no such thing as psychic 
sheldon what s the point 
just like schrodinger s cat your potential relationship with leonard right now can be thought of as both good and bad it is only by opening the box that you ll find out which it is 
okay so you re saying i should go out with leonard 
no no no no no no let me start again in 1935 erwin schrodinger 
two seats right there 
sheldon i think i ve made a mistake 
i can see that unless you re planning on running a marathon choosing both stuffing and mashed potatoes is a starch filled redundancy 
no it s about penny 
a mistake involving penny okay you ll have to narrow it down 
i don t think i can go out with her tonight 
then don t 
other people would say why not 
other people might be interested 
i m going to talk anyway 
i assumed you would 
now that i m actually about to go out with penny i m not excited i m nauseous 
ah then your meal choice is appropriate starch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit available for violent expulsion 
right 
you also made a common grammatical mistake you said nauseous when you meant nauseated but go on 
sheldon this date is probably my one chance with penny what happens if i blow it 
well if we accept your premise and also accept the highly improbable assumption that penny is the only woman in the world for you then we can logically conclude that the result of blowing it would be that you end up a lonely bitter old man with no progeny the image of any number of evil lighthouse keepers from scooby doo cartoons comes to mind 
you re not helping 
alright what response on my part would bring this conversation to a speedy conclusion 
tell me whether or not to go through with the date 
schrodinger s cat 
wow that s brilliant 
you sound surprised mmm hou zi shui zai li du 
hi 
hi 
come on in 
thank you you look very nice 
thank you so do you 
i made an eight o clock reservation 
okay great listen um maybe we should talk first 
oh okay but before you say anything have you ever heard of schrodinger s cat 
actually i ve heard far too much about schrodinger s cat 
good 
alright the cat s alive let s go to dinner 
show me your mucus your mucus 
this is not a tangerine bicycle
